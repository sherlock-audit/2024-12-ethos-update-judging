# Precision loss while calculating `pricePerVote` in ReputationMarket::sellVotes

### Summary

The `sellVotes` function in the `ReputationMarket` contract calculates the price per vote by dividing `proceedsBeforeFees` by `votesToSell`. This calculation may lead to precision loss due to integer division in Solidity, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or failed transactions when the calculated price does not meet the `minimumVotePrice` requirement.

### Root Cause

Solidity uses integer arithmetic, truncating any fractional part during division. As a result, `proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell` may not accurately represent the true price per vote. The issue lies in the `sellVotes` function, line where `pricePerVote` is calculated.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `sellVotes` function.

### Impact

- Rejection of valid transactions where the actual price per vote should meet the `minimumVotePrice`.
- Potential underestimation of the per-vote price in edge cases.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a scaling factor (e.g., 10**18) to preserve precision during division.
