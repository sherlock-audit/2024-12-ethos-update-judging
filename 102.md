# Incorrect rounding direction in cost calculation: `_calcCost()` will lead to potential initial fund loss for market.

### Summary
The incorrect rounding direction in the [`_calcCost()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1017-L1059) function of `ReputationMarket.sol` may cause potential fund loss and break the main invariant.

According to the [Ethos Update README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update?tab=readme-ov-file#q-what-propertiesinvariants-do-you-want-to-hold-even-if-breaking-them-has-a-lowunknown-impact)
> **The contract must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading**. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.

The function currently rounds based on the outcome side (`isPositive`) instead of the action (buying or selling). This leads to the protocol paying out more than intended when users sell `DISTRUST` votes, especially in markets with low liquidity param and base price configurations.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol](ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol), the `_calcCost()` function rounds based on the outcome side (`isPositive`). Its rounding direction will always round up when handling `TRUST` votes and round down when handling `DISTRUST` votes in both `BUY` and `SELL` actions.

This makes sense in the odds calculation (`votePrice`, which is the derivative of the cost calculation) as it aims to calculate the chance of outcomes so it should maintain the sum to 1 (`basePrice`). 

However, the cost calculation should be treated differently as this represents the payout cost that users have to pay (BUY) or receive (SELL) for votes in each market.

```solidity
function _calcCost(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    bool isBuy,
    uint256 amount
  ) private pure returns (uint256 cost) {

--- SNIPPED ---

    uint256 positiveCostRatio = costRatio > 0 ? uint256(costRatio) : uint256(costRatio * -1);
    // multiply cost ratio by base price to get cost; divide by 1e18 to apply ratio
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
1057: isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );
  }
```

Consider the action of selling `DISTRUST` votes (ref. PoC). The **total sale will round up** (if it is not modulo 0 for the numerator and denominator: [Openzeppelin/Math.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol#L228-L230)). Therefore, **this rounding will cause the user to receive more than the actual sale**, which is unfavorable to the protocol. 

This can easily happen in markets with low configurations, as the market configuration condition allows the minimum configuration to be `liquidity (b): 100` and `basePrice: 0.0001 ether (MINIMUM_BASE_PRICE)`. There is potential for these issues to occur and also break the protocol invariants.

### Internal pre-conditions

* A market with low liquidity param and low base price configuration is available.

### Impact

The protocol **suffers a potential loss of initial liquidity due to incorrect rounding in cost calculations**. Even though the rounding will cause a loss of 1 wei per selling time, users can partially sell the amount they own to extract the initial funds from the rounding issue.

According to the [Sherlock criteria about invariant breaking](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#iii.-sherlocks-standards), I believe this issue does not conflict with common sense and can be treated as **Medium**.

> Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, could be assigned Medium severity if it doesn't conflict with common sense. High severity will be applied only if the issue falls into the High severity category in the judging guidelines.

### Mitigation
- Adjust the rounding direction in the `_calcCost()` function to be based on the market action (buying or selling) rather than the outcome side (`isPositive`).
