# Sell slippage is applied before fees

### Summary
When selling, the user specifies a `minimumVotePrice` - this is the minimum average price they're willing to sell their votes at. 

```solidity
    (uint256 proceedsBeforeFees, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 proceedsAfterFees) = _calculateSell(
      markets[profileId],
      profileId,
      isPositive,
      votesToSell
    );

    uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
    if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
      revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
    }
```

As we can see however, the actual `pricePerVote` is calculated using `proceedsBeforeFees`, which does not have the protocol fees deducted. As a result, the user's slippage is applied before the protocol takes their fees and the user can still receive less funds than what they've explicitly specified.

### Root Cause
Wrong logic

### Attack Path
1. User wishes to sell 10 votes and sets `minimumVotePrice` to 0.1 ETH.
2. The total vote price before fees is calculated to 1.01 ETH. As 0.101 > 0.1 ETH, the slippage passes.
3. The protocol then takes their 5% fee. 
4. The user receives ~0.96 ETH. This is an average price of 0.096 per token. Although the user explicitly specified a minimum vote price of 0.1 ETH.


### Impact
User receives less than specified.

### Mitigation
Calculate the average price using `proceedsAfterFees` instead of `proceedsBeforeFees`.
