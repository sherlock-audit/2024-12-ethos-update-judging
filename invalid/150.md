# Absence of activeMarket Modifier in updateDonationRecipient Allows Updates for Inactive Markets

### Summary

The `updateDonationRecipient` function lacks the `activeMarket` modifier, which ensures that updates can only occur for active markets. Without this modifier, a user can update the donation recipient for a market that has been marked as inactive (graduated). This oversight can result in unintended or unauthorized changes in inactive markets.

### Root Cause

Assume profileId corresponds to a graduated (inactive) market (e.g., `graduatedMarkets[profileId] == true`).
Call `updateDonationRecipient(profileId, newRecipient)` with valid parameters.
The function executes without errors, allowing the recipient to be updated despite the market being inactive.


### Internal Pre-conditions

graduatedMarkets[profileId] is set to true for the market corresponding to profileId.
The caller is the current donation recipient for the inactive market.
The newRecipient meets the required conditions (no balance and matching profileId).

### External Pre-conditions

The smart contract is deployed and operational.
The profileId being targeted corresponds to an inactive market.
The user is aware of the market's inactive status but proceeds to call the function.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Donations intended for a retired market may be redirected to unauthorized recipients.

### PoC

Assume profileId corresponds to a graduated (inactive) market (e.g., graduatedMarkets[profileId] == true).
Call updateDonationRecipient(profileId, newRecipient) with valid parameters.
The function executes without errors, allowing the recipient to be updated despite the market being inactive.

### Mitigation

Add activeMarket Modifier:
Update the updateDonationRecipient function to include the activeMarket modifier:

     function updateDonationRecipient(
         uint256 profileId,
          address newRecipient
     ) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant activeMarket(profileId) {  
         // Function body  
     }
