# MEDIUM Redundant Market Existence Check in _emitMarketUpdate Function

### Summary

The `_emitMarketUpdate` function includes a call to _checkMarketExists(profileId), but this check is unnecessary. Since `_emitMarketUpdate` is a private function, it can only be called by other functions within the contract. The functions that invoke `_emitMarketUpdate` already implement the check for the existence of the market (marketExists). Therefore, calling _checkMarketExists again within `_emitMarketUpdate` results in redundant code and additional gas costs. Removing this unnecessary check will simplify the code, reduce gas usage, and improve contract efficiency without affecting functionality.

### Impact

- **Increased Gas Costs:**
The redundant call to _checkMarketExists(profileId) adds unnecessary gas consumption. Since the market existence is already validated by the functions calling _emitMarketUpdate, repeating the check wastes resources.

- **Reduced Code Efficiency:**
The extra validation increases the complexity of the contract without providing any additional functionality. This makes the code harder to maintain and understand, as it introduces unnecessary checks.

### Mitigation

```diff
function _emitMarketUpdate(uint256 profileId) private {
-   _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    .
    .
    .
