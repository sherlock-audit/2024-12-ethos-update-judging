# MEDIUM Exploitable MarketConfig Swapping Allows Fee Avoidance

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket:removeMarketConfig` function swaps the removed market configuration with the last element in the array. This behavior can be exploited by users who have already paid for a lower-cost configuration. If the admin swaps the configuration with one that has a higher cost before the market is created, the user can bypass the higher cost because their payment is based on the earlier, cheaper configuration.

### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol removing of market config causes some confusions

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- If the admin absorbs the creation cost: Users can bypass higher fees by exploiting swapped configurations.

### PoC

Since the admin contract is not created this can be only theory.

Initial market configs

```json
marketConfigs = [
    {liquidity: 1000, basePrice: 0.01 ether,creationCost: 0.2 ether },
    {liquidity: 10000, basePrice: 0.01 ether,creationCost: 0.5 ether },
    {liquidity: 100000, basePrice: 0.01 ether,creationCost: 1 ether }
];
```

**Steps:**
- User pays admin to create a market config at index 1 (2nd market config).
- Admin updates market configs before creating market for paid user
- When admin removes the 2nd market config then 3rd market config comes into 2nd market config place. It is as follows.

```json
marketConfigs = [
    {liquidity: 1000, basePrice: 0.01 ether,creationCost: 0.2 ether },
    {liquidity: 100000, basePrice: 0.01 ether,creationCost: 1 ether }
];
```
- Now Admin creates market for alredy paid user at index 1 (2nd market config) buyt now it is updated. This will make user benefit.

### Mitigation

Add the below mapping in `ReputationMarket` contract.

```diff
    .
    .
    .
    //Mappings
+   mapping(uint256 index=>bool) private marketConfigsStatus;
    .
    .
+    function _createMarket(uint256 profileId,address recipient,uint256 marketConfigIndex) private nonReentrant returns(bool,string memory) {
    // In the above function added the return value
    if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] != 0 || markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] != 0)
      revert MarketAlreadyExists(profileId);

    // ensure the specified config option is valid
    if (marketConfigIndex >= marketConfigs.length)
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Invalid config index");

    uint256 creationCost = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].creationCost;

    // Handle creation cost, refunds and market funds for non-admin users
    if (!hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
      if (msg.value < creationCost) revert InsufficientLiquidity(creationCost);
      marketFunds[profileId] = creationCost;
      if (msg.value > creationCost) {
        _sendEth(msg.value - creationCost);
      }
    } else {
      // when an admin creates a market, there is no minimum creation cost; use whatever they sent
      marketFunds[profileId] = msg.value;
+     if(!marketConfigsStatus[marketConfigIndex]){
+        return (false,"Market Status Inactive");
+    }
    }
    .
    .
    .

    return (true,"");

  }

```

- Based on the return value the admin contract can return the funds paid by users back to them instead of creating a market which costs more costs.

```diff
function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    .
    .
    .

    // Remove the last element
-   marketConfigs.pop();
+   marketConfigsStatus[configIndex]=false
  }
```
