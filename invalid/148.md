# In Reputation market.sol , there is no check for liquidity max limit

### Summary

in LSMR.sol, it is recommended , that b value should be in range of 100-1000000, but while adding new market config , only min amount is checked and max value is not checked

### Root Cause

When lqiuidtiy price will cross that value and set to that value , then problem will occur like precision loss and no price changes as in exp very large value will be there and it will cause no changes in price  and very high value will be require. It is not only stable but also price dont change properly due to precision loss. 

like there is overflow problem in low liquidity, in large liquidity, problem of precisin loss will be there
