# `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()` No Check Against LMSR's Vote Limit Before Purchase Attempt

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket` contract, the `buyVotes` function does not check if adding votes would exceed the safe operational limit set by the LMSR library `(votes â‰¤ 133 * liquidityParameter)`. Although the LMSR library internally checks for this limit and reverts if exceeded, the absence of this check at the `ReputationMarket` level can lead to unnecessary transaction failures, confusion, and wasted gas.

### Root Cause

```JavaScript
function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 maxVotesToBuy,
    uint256 minVotesToBuy
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    // ... (code not shown)
    uint256 currentVotesToBuy = maxVotesToBuy;
    while (totalCostIncludingFees > msg.value) {
        currentVotesToBuy--;
        // ... (code not shown)
    }
    // ... (code not shown)
}
 ```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User Experience: Users might repeatedly attempt transactions that fail due to vote limits, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of the platform.

Gas Waste: Each failed transaction consumes gas, unnecessarily increasing costs for users and adding to network congestion.
Market Efficiency: Markets might become temporarily inoperable if they consistently hit their vote cap without users understanding why their transactions are failing.

Security: While not directly exploitable, a lack of proactive error handling could be used in a denial-of-service context by initiating numerous failed transactions.


### PoC

Here's a test scenario illustrating how a purchase might exceed the LMSR limit:


```JavaScript
function test_BuyVotes_ExceedsLMSRLimit() public {
    uint256 profileId = 1;
    bool isPositive = true;
    uint256 liquidityParameter = 1000; // Example liquidity parameter
    uint256 maxSafeVotes = 133 * liquidityParameter; // Theoretical max safe votes
    uint256 votesToBuy = maxSafeVotes + 1; // Attempt to buy one vote over the limit

    // Mock market state
    markets[profileId].liquidityParameter = liquidityParameter;
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] = maxSafeVotes; // Market already at limit

    // Attempt to buy votes, expect revert
    vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(VotesExceedSafeLimit.selector, maxSafeVotes + 1, liquidityParameter, maxSafeVotes));
    buyVotes{value: 1 ether}(profileId, isPositive, votesToBuy, 1);
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a check in `buyVotes` or `_calcCost` to ensure the new vote count does not exceed the LMSR safe limit


```JavaScript
function _calcCost(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    bool isBuy,
    uint256 amount
  ) private pure returns (uint256 cost) {
    uint256 maxSafeVotes = 133 * market.liquidityParameter;
    uint256 currentVotes = isPositive ? market.votes[TRUST] : market.votes[DISTRUST];
    uint256 newVotes = isBuy ? currentVotes + amount : currentVotes - amount;

    if (newVotes > maxSafeVotes) {
        revert VotesExceedSafeLimit(newVotes, market.liquidityParameter, maxSafeVotes);
    }

    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

Or directly in `buyVotes`:
    
```JavaScript
function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 maxVotesToBuy,
    uint256 minVotesToBuy
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    uint256 maxSafeVotes = 133 * markets[profileId].liquidityParameter;
    uint256 currentVotes = markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];
    if (currentVotes + maxVotesToBuy > maxSafeVotes) {
        revert VotesExceedSafeLimit(currentVotes + maxVotesToBuy, markets[profileId].liquidityParameter, maxSafeVotes);
    }
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```
