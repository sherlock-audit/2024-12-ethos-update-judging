# The `updateDonationRecipient()` Function is Not Safe.

### Summary
When a user with multiple markets calls the `updateDonationRecipient()` function, the user risks lossing funds.

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path

### Impact
Potential loss of funds.

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L415
The vulnerability can be demonstrated through the following link, which shows it is possible that a deleted address from one profile can be re-registered to another profile.
As a result, there are some users who have multiple markets.

```solidity
    function updateDonationRecipient(
        uint256 profileId,
        address newRecipient
    ) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

        // if the new donation recipient has a balance, do not allow overwriting
        if (donationEscrow[newRecipient] != 0)
        revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Donation recipient has balance");

        // Ensure the sender is the current donation recipient
        if (msg.sender != donationRecipient[profileId]) revert InvalidProfileId();

        // Ensure the new recipient has the same Ethos profileId
        uint256 recipientProfileId = _ethosProfileContract().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(newRecipient);
        if (recipientProfileId != profileId) revert InvalidProfileId();

        // Update the donation recipient reference
        donationRecipient[profileId] = newRecipient;
        // Swap the current donation balance to the new recipient
        donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender];
642     donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
        emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, msg.sender, newRecipient);
    }
```
At line 642, the function sets donationEscrow[msg.sender] to zero after transferring the funds to newRecipient. This can lead to unintended loss of funds, particularly for users with multiple markets.

### Mitigation
Consider using the profileId as parameters for the donationEscrow.
