# Contract Balance May Become Less Than Total Active Market Funds Due to Fee Transfers

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract violates the invariant that "Total contract balance must be greater or equal to all active (non-graduated) market funds." This issue arises because protocol fees and donations are immediately transferred out of the contract during buy and sell operations, reducing the contract's ETH balance without a corresponding decrease in `marketFunds`. As a result, over time, the contract's balance can become less than the total `marketFunds` of all active markets, potentially leading to scenarios where the contract cannot fulfill its obligations to users during withdrawals or market graduations.

### Root Cause

## **Broken Invariant**

From the contract's documentation:

> **Total contract balance must be greater or equal to all active (non-graduated) market funds**

---


- **Immediate Transfer of Fees and Donations:**

  In the `applyFees` function, protocol fees are immediately sent to the `protocolFeeAddress`, and donations are allocated to `donationEscrow`. This reduces the contract's ETH balance.

```solidity
  function applyFees(
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
  ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
      // Allocate donation to escrow
      donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation;

      // Transfer protocol fees immediately
      if (protocolFee > 0) {
          (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
          if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
      }
      fees = protocolFee + donation;
  }
  ```

- **Market Funds Not Adjusted for Fees:**

  In the `buyVotes` and `sellVotes` functions, `marketFunds` is adjusted by `purchaseCostBeforeFees` or `proceedsBeforeFees`, which do not include fees or donations. Therefore, `marketFunds` does not account for ETH leaving the contract due to fees.

  ```solidity
  // In buyVotes:
  marketFunds[profileId] += purchaseCostBeforeFees;

  // In sellVotes:
  marketFunds[profileId] -= proceedsBeforeFees;
  ```

- **Contract Balance Reduction Without Corresponding Adjustment:**

  As fees and donations are transferred out, the contract's ETH balance decreases. However, since `marketFunds` is not reduced by these amounts, the total `marketFunds` can exceed the contract's ETH balance, violating the invariant.

### Attack Path

While this issue may not be directly exploitable by a malicious actor to drain funds, it can lead to a scenario where the contract is unable to meet its obligations due to internal accounting inconsistencies.

**Scenario Steps:**

1. **Users Buy Votes with Fees and Donations:**

   - A user buys votes:

     - `purchaseCostBeforeFees`: 10 ETH
     - Protocol fee (e.g., 5%): 0.5 ETH
     - Donation (e.g., 2%): 0.2 ETH
     - `totalCostIncludingFees`: 10.7 ETH

   - `marketFunds` increases by `purchaseCostBeforeFees` (10 ETH).

   - The contract's ETH balance increases by `totalCostIncludingFees` (10.7 ETH).

   - Protocol fee and donation are immediately transferred out:

     ```solidity
     applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);
     ```

     - Contract's ETH balance net increase: 10.7 ETH - 0.5 ETH (protocol fee) = 10.2 ETH
     - Donation is allocated to `donationEscrow`, reducing available funds for market obligations.

2. **Repeated Transactions Reduce Available Balance:**

   - Repeating such transactions, the contract's ETH balance continues to decrease relative to `marketFunds` due to the immediate transfer of fees and allocation of donations.

3. **Violation of Invariant:**

   - Over time, the total `marketFunds` can exceed the contract's ETH balance.

     - **Example:**

       - Total `marketFunds`: 200 ETH
       - Contract's ETH balance: 180 ETH (due to 20 ETH in protocol fees and donations transferred out)

   - Contract balance (180 ETH) < Total `marketFunds` (200 ETH)

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC


### **Setup**

- **Initial State:**

  - Contract's ETH Balance: 100 ETH
  - `marketFunds[Market A]`: 100 ETH
  - Protocol fees and donations are not yet collected.

### **Transaction 1: User Buys Votes**

- **User Buys Votes in Market A:**

  ```solidity
  // Variables
  uint256 purchaseCostBeforeFees = 10 ETH;
  uint256 protocolFee = 0.5 ETH; // 5% of 10 ETH
  uint256 donation = 0.2 ETH;    // 2% of 10 ETH
  uint256 totalCostIncludingFees = 10 ETH + 0.5 ETH + 0.2 ETH = 10.7 ETH;
  ```

- **Contract State Changes:**

  - `marketFunds[Market A]` increases by `purchaseCostBeforeFees` (10 ETH):

    ```solidity
    marketFunds[marketAProfileId] += purchaseCostBeforeFees; // +10 ETH
    ```

  - Contract's ETH balance increases by `totalCostIncludingFees` (10.7 ETH):

    ```solidity
    // User sends 10.7 ETH to the contract
    ```

  - Protocol fee and donation are transferred out or allocated:

    ```solidity
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, marketAProfileId);
    ```

    - Contract's ETH balance decreases by protocol fee (0.5 ETH):

      ```solidity
      // Send 0.5 ETH to protocolFeeAddress
      ```

    - Donation (0.2 ETH) is allocated to `donationEscrow` (not immediately affecting ETH balance but reserved).

  - **Net Changes:**

    - Contract's ETH balance net increase: 10.7 ETH - 0.5 ETH = 10.2 ETH
    - `marketFunds[Market A]` increased by 10 ETH
    - `donationEscrow` increased by 0.2 ETH (reserved funds)

### **Contract Balance vs. Market Funds**

- **After Transaction 1:**

  - `marketFunds[Market A]`: 110 ETH (initial 100 ETH + 10 ETH)
  - Contract's ETH balance: 110.2 ETH (initial 100 ETH + net increase 10.2 ETH)
  - **Contract Balance (110.2 ETH) >= `marketFunds` (110 ETH)**

- **However, 0.2 ETH in `donationEscrow` is reserved and effectively reduces available ETH.**

- **Available ETH Balance:** 110.2 ETH - 0.2 ETH (donations) = 110 ETH

### **Repeated Transactions**

- **Over Time:**

  - Protocol fees and donations continue to be transferred out or allocated.
  - Contract's ETH balance grows at a slower rate than `marketFunds` due to fees being sent out.

- **Example After Multiple Transactions:**

  - Total `marketFunds` across all markets: 500 ETH
  - Contract's ETH balance: 480 ETH
  - Donations in `donationEscrow`: 10 ETH
  - **Available ETH Balance:** 480 ETH - 10 ETH = 470 ETH

- **Result:**

  - Available ETH Balance (470 ETH) < Total `marketFunds` (500 ETH)
  - **Invariant Violated:** Contract balance is less than total `marketFunds`

### Mitigation

To maintain the invariant and ensure that the contract has sufficient funds to meet its obligations, adjust `marketFunds` to account for protocol fees and donations that are transferred out or allocated.

- **Subtract Fees from `marketFunds` During Transactions:**

  - **In `buyVotes`:**

    ```solidity
    // Adjust marketFunds by the net amount after fees and donations
    marketFunds[profileId] += purchaseCostBeforeFees - (protocolFee + donation);
    ```

  - **In `sellVotes`:**

    ```solidity
    // Adjust marketFunds by the net amount after fees
    marketFunds[profileId] -= proceedsBeforeFees - protocolFee;
    ```
