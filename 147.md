# Participant List Bloat

### Summary

A malicious or automated spammer will cause unbounded storage growth and potential Denial of Service for the protocol by creating thousands of small participant entries in a market’s participants[profileId] array.

In ReputationMarket, whenever a user calls buyVotes() for a specific market, if they were not previously marked as a participant (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]), they are appended to an on-chain array participants[profileId]. This array never removes participants, even if they sell all their votes. Consequently, an attacker can use multiple addresses (sybil addresses) to perform minimal buys and bloat the array, growing it indefinitely.

Impact
This bloat can lead to storage cost issues, extremely large arrays, and potential DOS in any future function or upgrade that iterates over participants[profileId]. It can also raise gas costs for other protocol interactions if they rely on enumerating or updating participant data.

### Root Cause

in  ReputationMarket.sol, inside buyVotes() (and similarly in other logic that might add participants):

```solidity

if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
    participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
    isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
}
```
There is no condition or cleanup to remove a participant if they later have zero votes.
An attacker with infinite addresses can spam minimal buys (like 0.0001 votes) to forever remain in participants.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract code uses an ever-growing array: participants[profileId].
No code path removes an address from participants[profileId] after their balance hits zero.

### External Pre-conditions

A malicious user has access to many addresses (e.g., wallet factory, bots, etc.).
The contract does not block minimal trades or have a minimum purchase that is large enough to discourage spamming.


### Attack Path

1- Attacker funds many addresses with trivial amounts of ETH (just enough for a buy).
2- Each address calls buyVotes(profileId, isPositive=..., maxVotesToBuy=1, minVotesToBuy=1).
3- The contract sees !isParticipant[profileId][thatAddress] and appends the address to participants[profileId].
4- The attacker either sells the vote or leaves it there—doesn’t matter, they remain in the array.
5- Repeats the process with thousands of addresses, causing unbounded growth in participants[profileId].


### Impact

Affected Party:
Potentially the protocol or future upgraders if they attempt enumerations or expansions on participants[profileId].
Also, any admin or function that aims to retrieve or process the entire participant list can face gas or storage blowups.

Result:
Data structure bloat: The array can become extremely large, leading to possible DOS if a future function tries to loop over it.
Gas Cost: On some L2s or especially for certain opcodes, reading or writing large arrays can become prohibitively expensive.

(Currently, the code does not appear to iterate over participants[profileId] in critical paths, but any feature or upgrade that does so could break.)

### PoC

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ReputationMarket.sol";

contract ParticipantsBloatTest is Test {
    ReputationMarket rm;
    address attacker = address(0xBAD);

    function setUp() public {
        rm = new ReputationMarket();
        // Suppose we create a market for profileId=123
    }

    function testParticipantsBloat() public {
        uint256 profileId = 123;

        // Attacker systematically spams addresses
        for(uint i = 0; i < 5000; i++){
            address spamAddr = address(uint160(i + 1000)); 
            vm.deal(spamAddr, 0.001 ether);

            vm.startPrank(spamAddr);
            // minimal buy to get appended as a participant
            rm.buyVotes{value: 0.0001 ether}(profileId, true, 1, 1);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // Now participants[profileId] might have 5,000 addresses.
        // The array is permanently large; no removal.
    }
}
```
After this loop, any future code that tries enumerating participants[profileId] could face large gas usage. If repeated multiple times, it can reach tens or hundreds of thousands of entries.



### Mitigation

1-Remove Participants on Zero Balance
When a user’s trust/distrust votes are sold down to zero, remove them from participants[profileId]. This can be somewhat gas-heavy, but it prevents indefinite bloat.

2-Use Off-Chain Indexing
Rely on events (e.g., VotesBought) for off-chain participant tracking. Then you don’t need a large on-chain array.

3-Enforce a Minimum Buy
Requiring a higher minimum buy can deter spammers from cheaply adding themselves.

4-Cap the Number of Participants
Introduce a maximum participant count or rely on a checkpoint-based approach to limit array growth.

5-Periodically Prune
Possibly an admin function that prunes addresses that sold all votes.
