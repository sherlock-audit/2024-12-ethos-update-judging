# Creating a market could lead to unexpected creation if the corresponding market configuration is removed.

### Summary

If the admin removes a market configuration, it is replaced by the last configuration.

If a user creates a market using the index of the removed configuration, a market will be created with the last configuration.

This situation can occur when the admin's removal and the user's creation happen within the same block.

### Root Cause

The [removeMarketConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L400) function replaces the removed configuration with the last one.

```solidity
      function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
        ...

        uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
        if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
400       marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
        }

        // Remove the last element
        marketConfigs.pop();
      }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. The admin initiates a transaction to remove the `n`th configuration.
2. A user initiates a transaction to create a market using the `n`th configuration.
3. Both transactions are executed within the same block:
  - The `n`th configuration is replaced by the last one.
  - The user's market is created with the new `n`th configuration.

As a result, a market is created with an unexpected configuration.

### Impact

Creating a market immediately after removing the corresponding configuration can lead to unexpected outcomes.

### PoC

### Mitigation

It is advisable to remove market configurations only when the contract is paused to prevent the creation of a market immediately after the removal.
