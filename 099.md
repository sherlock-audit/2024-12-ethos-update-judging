# Precision Loss in Odds Calculation for LMSR with High Vote Counts

### Summary
The Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) implementation exhibits a precision loss issue in the calculation of odds and vote prices when the number of "yes" and "no" votes are large and nearly equal relative to the liquidity parameter. This can lead to inaccurate odds calculations due to rounding errors in fixed-point arithmetic, potentially affecting market integrity.

### Root Cause
The [odds calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/LMSR.sol#L57-L74) relies on exponential terms scaled by the liquidity parameter `b`, which can result in precision loss when 
`yesVotes` and `noVotes` are large and nearly equal relative to ùëè. Formula for Odds:
```solidity
odds = e^(yesVotes / b) / (e^(yesVotes / b) + e^(noVotes / b))
```
When yesVotes and noVotes are very large and close in value:
- `e^(yesVotes / b)` and `e^(noVotes / b)` are nearly identical.
- The denominator `e^(yesVotes / b) + e^(noVotes / b)`  becomes dominated by these nearly equal terms.
- Fixed-point representation (like UD60x18) can struggle to represent small differences between the numerator and denominator accurately.

### Impact

The derived odds may not accurately reflect the true probabilities of outcomes, leading to vote prices that do not align with market expectations. For example, a discrepancy of approximately 0.000002ETH per vote could lead to a total discrepancy of around 0.266ETH across 13,300,000 votes.

### PoC

Odds Calculation for a Premium tier:
```solidity
odds = e^(yes/b) / (e^(yes/b) + e^(no/b))
```
Scenario A (Equal Votes):
For example, if both yesVotes and noVotes are 6,650,000:


```solidity
   yesVotes = 6650000
   noVotes = 6650000
   b = 1000000
```
```solidity
 Scaled Yes Votes = Yes Votes / b
                  = 6,650,000 / 1,000,000
                  = 6.65

 Scaled No Votes = No Votes / b
                  = 6,650,000 / 1,000,000
                  = 6.65
```


```solidity
 Exponential for Yes Votes:   e^(yes/b) = e^(6.65) ‚âà 769.23
 Exponential for No Votes:   e^(no/b) = e^(6.65) ‚âà 769.23
```


Scenario B (Slight Disparity):
```solidity
 yesVotes = 6,650,001 (an increase of 1)
 noVotes = 6,650,000
 
Calculate the exponentials:

  For Yes Votes:
     e^(6.650001) ‚âà 769.2305

  For No Votes:
     e^(6.65) ‚âà 769.23
```
If we round these values for fixed-point representation (for example, to two decimal places):
- e^6.650001 rounds to 769.23.
- e^6.65 also rounds to 769.23.

Even though there was a small difference in the input (yesVotes increased by just one), the resulting exponentials rounded to the same value due to the limitations of fixed-point arithmetic. Consequently, any small differences in e^yes/b and e^no/b are lost during rounding.


```solidity
     odds = 769.23 / (769.23 + 769.23)
          = 769.23 / 1538.46
          = 0.5
```

The vote price is derived using odds and a base price (e.g. 0.01 ETH).

Accurate Odds:
- If we assume a slight adjustment for accurate odds: 0.500002.
- Vote price:  0.500002 √ó 0.01 ETH = 0.00000500002 ETH.

Imprecise Odds:
- Using rounded odds: 0.5.
- Vote price: 0.5 √ó 0.01 ETH = 0.000005 ETH

Total Discrepancy Calculation:
- The difference per vote is: 0.500002 ‚àí 0.5 = 0.000002 ETH

Total discrepancy across all votes: 0.000002 ETH √ó 13,300,000 = 0.266 ETH.

### Mitigation
To reduce precision loss, the implementation can use a higher-precision fixed-point representation (e.g., UD128x18 or UD256x18), which increases the number of significant digits and helps preserve small differences in the numerator and denominator during the odds calculation.
