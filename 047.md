# Mutable Indices in `marketConfigs` May Lead to Incorrect Market Config Selection

### Summary

The `removeMarketConfig` function in the `ReputationMarket` contract changes the indices of configurations within the `marketConfigs` array when a configuration is removed. This is due to the swapping mechanism used before popping the last element. Since functions like `createMarketWithConfig` rely on indices to specify configurations, changing indices can cause users to inadvertently select incorrect configurations, leading to unexpected market parameters.

### Root Cause

The `removeMarketConfig` function removes a configuration by swapping it with the last element in the `marketConfigs` array and then calling `pop()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L388C1-L405C4

```solidity
function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    // Cannot remove if only one config remains
    if (marketConfigs.length <= 1) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Must keep one config");

    // Check if the index is valid
    if (configIndex >= marketConfigs.length) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("index not found");

    emit MarketConfigRemoved(configIndex, marketConfigs[configIndex]);

    // If this is not the last element, swap with the last element
    uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
        marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    }

    // Remove the last element
    marketConfigs.pop();
}
```

This method changes the indices of other configurations in the array. Any subsequent calls to functions that use these indices may inadvertently reference different configurations than intended.

### Attack Path


1. An admin removes a configuration from the `marketConfigs` array using `removeMarketConfig`, causing indices to shift.
2. A user, unaware of the index changes, calls `createMarketWithConfig` with an index that now points to a different configuration.
   
   ```solidity
   // User intends to use the configuration at index 1
   reputationMarket.createMarketWithConfig(1);
   ```
   
3. The userâ€™s market is created with unintended parameters (e.g., different liquidity or base price), which could affect the market's behavior and the user's funds.

### Impact

Markets could be created with higher creation costs or unfavorable liquidity parameters, leading to potential financial loss.

### PoC


1. **Initial State**: Three configurations exist with indices `[0, 1, 2]`.

   ```solidity
   // Config at index 0
   MarketConfig({ liquidity: 1000, basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE, creationCost: 0.2 ether });
   
   // Config at index 1
   MarketConfig({ liquidity: 10000, basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE, creationCost: 0.5 ether });
   
   // Config at index 2
   MarketConfig({ liquidity: 100000, basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE, creationCost: 1.0 ether });
   ```

2. **Admin Removes Config at Index 1**:

   ```solidity
   reputationMarket.removeMarketConfig(1);
   ```

   - The configuration at index 1 is swapped with the last configuration (index 2) and then removed.
   - New indices after removal:

     - Index 0: Unchanged
     - Index 1: Originally at index 2
     - Length of `marketConfigs` is now 2.

3. **User Attempts to Create Market with Original Config at Index 1**:

   ```solidity
   // User intends to use the 'Deluxe' configuration
   reputationMarket.createMarketWithConfig(1);
   ```

   - The user expects to use the configuration with `liquidity: 10000`, but instead gets `liquidity: 100000` due to the index shift.
   - This leads to a higher creation cost and different market dynamics than intended.

### Mitigation


- **Use Unique Identifiers**: Assign a unique identifier (e.g., an auto-incrementing ID) to each `MarketConfig` and store configurations in a mapping. This ensures that each configuration can be referenced consistently, regardless of array index changes.

  ```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => MarketConfig) public marketConfigs;
  uint256 public nextConfigId;

  function addMarketConfig(...) public {
      marketConfigs[nextConfigId] = MarketConfig(...);
      nextConfigId++;
  }
  ```

- **Avoid Index-Based References**: Modify functions like `createMarketWithConfig` to accept the unique identifier instead of an index.

  ```solidity
  function createMarketWithConfig(uint256 configId) public {
      MarketConfig storage config = marketConfigs[configId];
      require(config.liquidity != 0, "Invalid config");
      // Proceed to create market
  }
  ```

- **Mark Configurations as Inactive**: Instead of removing configurations and shifting indices, mark configurations as inactive (e.g., by adding an `active` flag). This preserves indices and allows checks for active configurations.

  ```solidity
  struct MarketConfig {
      uint256 liquidity;
      uint256 basePrice;
      uint256 creationCost;
      bool active;
  }

  function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public {
      marketConfigs[configIndex].active = false;
  }
  ```
