# Lack of input validation for buyVotes parameters can confuse users and create unexpected behavior

### Summary

The absence of a check ensuring `minVotesToBuy <= maxVotesToBuy` in `buyVotes` can lead to confusion or unexpected behavior for users, as the function does not validate these parameters, potentially allowing contradictory inputs.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#L440C1-L450C1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440C1-L450C1), `buyVotes` accepts `maxVotesToBuy` and `minVotesToBuy` as parameters, but never checks that `minVotesToBuy <= maxVotesToBuy`. This gap can produce conflicting instructions and unexpected user experience.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user calls `buyVotes` with parameters `maxVotesToBuy` and `minVotesToBuy` where `minVotesToBuy` is greater than `maxVotesToBuy` or otherwise illogical.
2. No internal checks enforce consistency between these two parameters.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user mistakenly calls `buyVotes(profileId, true, 5, 10)`, implying a desire to buy at least 10 votes but no more than 5.
2. The function checks only if the user can afford `minVotesToBuy` and attempts to purchase `maxVotesToBuy` â€” leading to contradictory states or user confusion.
3. Because no explicit requirement ensures `minVotesToBuy <= maxVotesToBuy`, the input can pass silently, producing undefined or confusing results.

### Impact

Users could have a confusing or misleading experience, expecting at least a certain minimum but capping at a smaller maximum. While this might not directly cause financial loss, it risks incorrectly handled orders or user frustration, potentially leading to a breakdown of market trust.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Add Parameter Validation:** In `buyVotes`, revert if `minVotesToBuy > maxVotesToBuy`.
