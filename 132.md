# Withdrawing funds from a graduated market does not send fee to the `protocolFeeAddress`

## Summary
Whenever a user buys or sells vote, appropriate fees is calculated which is sent to the `protocolFeeAddress`. 
However when the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` is called the funds are sent to the authorized caller but it does not send any fee as it is missing the call to the `applyFees()`.

## Proof
As we can see below that when the authorized address call the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`, the funds stored in `marketFunds` is sent to the caller.
```solidity
File: ReputationMarket.sol

   function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();

    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) revert MarketNotGraduated();

    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) revert InsufficientFunds();

    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```
But there is no call to `applyFees()`. Had the votes been sold, the protocol fee would have been sent but since `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` is missing `applyFees()`, nothing is sent. 

## Impact
No protocol fee is sent to the `protocolFeeAddress` when funds from a graduated market (which still holds some funds) are withdrawn.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the fee for selling the remaining votes at the time of withdrawing from a graduated market & call `applyFees()` to send the fee to the `protocolFeeAddress`.
