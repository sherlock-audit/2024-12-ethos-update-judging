# While-Loop DOS in buyVotes()

### Summary

A malicious front-end will cause a self-inflicted gas exhaustion (DOS) for unsuspecting users attempting to buy votes.

In the function` buyVotes(),` there is a naive decrement loop that subtracts 1 from the `currentVotesToBuy` until `msg.value` suffices for the cost. This loop can iterate an extremely large number of times if `maxVotesToBuy` is set to a huge value (e.g., 2^256 - 1). As a result, the transaction runs out of gas and reverts.

Impact
This flaw will cause a denial of service for users as a malicious front-end can exploit it by providing a massive maxVotesToBuy, forcing the function to exceed block gas limits and revert.

### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket.sol` (the relevant lines typically reside within the `buyVotes() `function), the problematic code is (roughly):

```solidity

while (totalCostIncludingFees > msg.value) {
    currentVotesToBuy--;
    (purchaseCostBeforeFees, protocolFee, donation, totalCostIncludingFees) = 
        _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, currentVotesToBuy);
}
```
The design choice to decrement currentVotesToBuy by 1 in a loop is a mistake because no upper bound is enforced on maxVotesToBuy, allowing a massive iteration count that triggers out-of-gas reverts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1-Admin does not impose any limit on maxVotesToBuy in the function call or in an external check.
2-No other code path restricts or bounds the size of maxVotesToBuy.
3-buyVotes() is being called with a sufficiently large maxVotesToBuy such that decrementing from that value one step at a time is extremely gas-costly.

### External Pre-conditions

1-The user is using a malicious front-end or script that sets maxVotesToBuy to a massive value (e.g., 2^256 - 1).
2-The network (e.g., Base L2) has a block gas limit which cannot accommodate the extremely large loop.


### Attack Path

1-An attacker (or malicious dApp) presents a user interface where maxVotesToBuy is set to an absurdly high number (e.g., type(uint256).max).
2-The user, unaware of this, calls buyVotes() with the monstrous maxVotesToBuy.
3-Inside buyVotes(), the while-loop attempts to decrement from that huge number until totalCostIncludingFees <= msg.value.
4-The loop consumes all available gas.
5-The transaction reverts, causing the user to lose any gas spent. The user cannot successfully buy votes.

### Impact

Affected Party: The user attempting to buy votes.
Loss: The user loses their gas for a reverted transaction and cannot complete the buy.
Denial-of-Service: If such calls repeat, it can hamper usage or break dApp flows for unsuspecting participants. There’s no direct profit for the attacker, but it griefs or disrupts user trades.


### PoC

Below is a test demonstration in Foundry (or Hardhat) style. The key is setting `maxVotesToBuy `to an enormous value and watching the transaction fail due to gas exhaustion:

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ReputationMarket.sol"; // your contract's import

contract WhileLoopDOSAttackTest is Test {
    ReputationMarket rm;

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy or set up ReputationMarket instance
        rm = new ReputationMarket();
        // Assume any necessary initializations...
    }

    function testDOSViaHugeMaxVotesToBuy() public {
        // Let's say profileId is 12345, 
        // and we've pre-created a market for it, 
        // and we want to buy trust votes (isPositive = true).
        uint256 profileId = 12345; 
        bool isPositive = true;

        // We prepare a huge number for maxVotesToBuy
        uint256 maxVotesToBuy = type(uint256).max;  

        // Provide some ETH in msg.value
        vm.deal(address(this), 10 ether);

        vm.expectRevert(); 
        // We expect the transaction to revert due to out-of-gas (or explicit revert).
        rm.buyVotes{value: 1 ether}(profileId, isPositive, maxVotesToBuy, 1);
    }
}
```

When run, the transaction consumes all gas or triggers the revert scenario.



### Mitigation

1-Replace the naive loop with a binary search or a closed-form approach to directly calculate the maximum affordable votes.
2-Enforce an upper limit on maxVotesToBuy (e.g., disallow inputs > 10^6, or some practical bound) to prevent extreme iteration.
3-Fail Fast if msg.value is insufficient to buy maxVotesToBuy from the start—no need to decrement one by one.
