# isParticipant is not updated when a user sells all their votes

### Summary

Participants of the market associated to each profileId are tracked by ```participants``` and ```isParticipant``` mappings. The first one expects to contain the historic participant addresses of each market, while the second one must tell if a user is currently participant of a given market.

isParticipant is set to true when a user buys any number of votes in a market, but is never set to false again if they sell all their votes in that market, breaking the expected behviour of the variable.

### Root Cause

When user calls buyVotes() for a given market, the isParticipant mapping for that market and address is set to true, but when they sell votes there is no mechanism that sets isParticipant to false in case they have sold all their votes, which is the expected behviour of the function according to the natspec shown above.

### Impact

User will remain as a current participant of a given market even if they sell all their votes, clearly breaking the expected operation mode of the isParticipant mapping which should specifically be used for checking if a user is a participant of a market or not according to natspec.

### Mitigation

Set isParticipant to false in case a user sells are their votes of a given market:

```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 votesToSell,
    uint256 minimumVotePrice
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    (uint256 proceedsBeforeFees, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 proceedsAfterFees) = _calculateSell(
      markets[profileId],
      profileId,
      isPositive,
      votesToSell
    );

    uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
    if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
      revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
    }

    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesToSell;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesToSell;

+ if (votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0 &&
+     votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0){
+         isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
+ }

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= proceedsBeforeFees;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(proceedsAfterFees);

    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesToSell,
      proceedsAfterFees,
      block.timestamp
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
