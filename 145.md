# Using isPositive to determine rounding in _calcCost(…) instead of isBuy (or a similar variable) can lead to a 1 wei discrepancy during buy/sell operations.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1017
A subtle but important bug lurks in _calcCost(…) at the very end where it applies rounding based on isPositive instead of isBuy. In other words, it uses:
```solidity
cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
    market.basePrice,
    1e18,
    isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
);
```

But whether we should round up or down actually depends on whether the user is buying or selling, not whether they’re buying “trust” (positive) or “distrust” (negative). By keying off of isPositive, the code can produce unintended outcomes.

Why it’s a bug
	1.	When buying (isBuy = true)
	•	Generally, the buyer wants an accurate (and slightly rounded up) figure to ensure they pay at least as much as the bonding curve dictates.
	2.	When selling (isBuy = false)
	•	The seller wants an accurate (and slightly rounded down) figure to ensure they don’t get overcharged on slippage.

Instead, the code is doing:

If you’re buying/selling trust (isPositive = true), do Math.Rounding.Floor;
If you’re buying/selling distrust (isPositive = false), do Math.Rounding.Ceil.

That logic was presumably intended to ensure the prices of “trust” plus “distrust” always total the basePrice. However, by mixing up which side of the trade you’re on (buy vs. sell) with whether the trade is on the trust or distrust side, the final cost or proceeds for each trade can be off by 1 wei in the wrong direction, causing price or revenue mismatches over many transactions.

Inside _calcCost(…), the last line should decide rounding based on isBuy rather than isPositive.
