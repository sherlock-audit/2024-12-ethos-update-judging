# Initial Liquidity Deposited as Part of Trading Could Be Consumed.

### Summary
In L1057, the rounding mode is not optimal.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1057

### Root Cause
In the `_calcCost()` function, the cost is rounded down for `TRUST` and rounded up for `DISTRUST`.
If there are more calls to buyVotes() than sellVotes() for `TRUST`, or fewer calls buyVotes() than sellVotes() for `DISTRUST`, the initial liquidity is decreased.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
1. Buy one `TRUST` vote n times and then sell all these votes at once.
2. Buy n `DISTRUST` votes at once and then sell these one by one n times.
At this point the `marketFunds` is decreased by approximately `n-1`.
The expected value of a random number in the range [0,1) is 0.5. Thus, the decreased value can be approximated as:
    `0.5 * (TRUST_buytimes - TRUST_selltimes) - 0.5 * (DISTRUST_buytimes - DISTRUST_selltimes) = (n-1)`.
This is not an exact value, but n could be larger as neccesary. Thus the initial Liquidity could be consumed.

### Impact
In Summary:
>The contract must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.

However, the initial liquidity could be consumed.

### PoC
```solidity
    function _calcCost(
        ...
    ) private pure returns (uint256 cost) {
        ...
        cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
            market.basePrice,
            1e18,
1057        isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );
    }
    The
```
### Mitigation
Consider adjusting the rounding mode in the calculation of cost separately when buying and selling to avoid unintended consumption of the initial liquidity.
