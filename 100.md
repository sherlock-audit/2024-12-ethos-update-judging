# Incorrect Slippage Check When Selling Votes

### Summary

The implementation of the slippage check in the `ReputationMarket` contract is flawed. Currently, the `minimumVotePrice` variable is used to prevent users from selling votes at a price that is too low. However, the comparison is made using `proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell` instead of `proceedsAfterFees / votesToSell`. This oversight allows users to potentially sell votes for a price lower than intended.

### Root Cause

The issue originates from the following code snippet:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L546-L556](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L546-L556)
```solidity
    (uint256 proceedsBeforeFees, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 proceedsAfterFees) = _calculateSell(
      markets[profileId],
      profileId,
      isPositive,
      votesToSell
    );

    uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
    if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
      revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
    }
```
In this code, `proceedsBeforeFees` represents the total value before any fees are deducted, while `proceedsAfterFees` reflects the value after fees have been applied.
Since the fees are included in the `proceedsBeforeFees` variable, the current calculation for `pricePerVote` effectively equates to using `proceedsAfterFees / votesToSell`.

### Impact

Due to this flaw, users may sell their votes for a price that is lower than the expected minimum, leading to potential financial losses.

### PoC

The correct logic dictates that when users sell votes through the protocol, they should first receive the proceeds from the sale and then pay any applicable fees. Therefore, it is essential to check the slippage against the net proceeds after fees have been deducted at the time of the sale.

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the calculation for `pricePerVote` should be adjusted to use `proceedsAfterFees` instead of `proceedsBeforeFees`. The corrected code is as follows:
```solidity
-   uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
```

```solidity
+   uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsAfterFees / votesToSell : 0;
```
