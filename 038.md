# Votes Exceeding Safe Limits Allow Attackers to Cause Denial-of-Service on Markets

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract uses the LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) library for calculating odds and costs in the market. The LMSR library has a mathematical limitation: the number of votes per side (trust or distrust) must not exceed approximately `133 * liquidityParameter`. Exceeding this limit causes LMSR calculations to revert due to overflow in the exponential function. The contract currently does not enforce this limit during vote purchases or sales, allowing an attacker to intentionally exceed the safe vote limit. By doing so, the attacker can cause all subsequent interactions with the market to fail, effectively creating a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition that prevents legitimate users from buying, selling, or interacting with the affected market.

### Root Cause

The LMSR library defines a maximum safe number of votes per side to prevent overflows in exponential calculations:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/LMSR.sol#L154C4-L164C6

 ```solidity
    uint256 maxSafeRatio = 133;
    if (
        yesVotes > maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter || noVotes > maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter
    ) {
        revert VotesExceedSafeLimit(
            yesVotes > noVotes ? yesVotes : noVotes,
            liquidityParameter,
            maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter
        );
    }
    ```

  - This limit is in place because the `exp()` function in the LMSR calculations can overflow if the input value (`votes / liquidityParameter`) exceeds approximately `133`.

- **No Checks in `ReputationMarket` for Vote Limits:**

  - The `ReputationMarket` contract does not enforce the maximum safe vote limits when users buy or sell votes.
  
  - Functions like `buyVotes` and `sellVotes` update the vote counts without checking against the LMSR safe limits:

    ```solidity
    // Example from buyVotes function
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += currentVotesToBuy;
    ```

- **Potential for Denial-of-Service:**

  - If the total votes for either trust or distrust exceed the safe limit, any function that relies on LMSR computations (e.g., `getVotePrice`, `buyVotes`, `sellVotes`) will revert due to overflow errors.

### Attack Path


An attacker can intentionally exceed the maximum safe votes for either trust or distrust votes in a market, causing all LMSR calculations to revert due to overflows. This prevents any further interactions with the market, denying service to all users.

### **Steps of the Attack**

1. **Identify Target Market:**

   - The attacker selects a specific market to target.

   - Retrieves the market's `liquidityParameter` to calculate the maximum safe vote limit.

2. **Calculate Maximum Safe Votes:**

   - Calculates `maxSafeVotes = 133 * liquidityParameter`.

   - Determines how many votes they need to purchase to exceed this limit.

3. **Accumulate Votes to Exceed Safe Limit:**

   - The attacker buys enough votes on one side (trust or distrust) to push the total votes over the safe limit.

   - There's no check in the `buyVotes` function to prevent this.

4. **Cause Denial-of-Service:**

   - Once the safe limit is exceeded, any LMSR function that involves the affected vote count will revert due to overflow checks in the LMSR library.

   - Functions like `buyVotes`, `sellVotes`, `getVotePrice`, and any other that relies on LMSR calculations will fail.


### Impact

Legitimate users will be unable to interact with the market, effectively causing a DoS condition on that market.

### PoC


From the LMSR code:

```solidity
uint256 maxSafeRatio = 133;
if (
    yesVotes > maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter || noVotes > maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter
) {
    revert VotesExceedSafeLimit(
        yesVotes > noVotes ? yesVotes : noVotes,
        liquidityParameter,
        maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter
    );
}
```

Therefore, the **maximum safe number of votes per side** (`trustVotes` or `distrustVotes`) is calculated as:

```solidity
maxSafeVotesPerSide = maxSafeRatio * liquidityParameter;
```

### **Calculations**

Assuming the following market parameters:

- **Liquidity Parameter (`b`):**

  ```solidity
  uint256 liquidityParameter = 1_000; // Example value for liquidity parameter
  ```

- **Calculating Maximum Safe Votes Per Side:**

  ```solidity
  uint256 maxSafeVotesPerSide = 133 * liquidityParameter; // For b = 1,000, maxSafeVotesPerSide = 133,000 votes
  ```

This means that if either `trustVotes` or `distrustVotes` exceed `133,000` votes, the LMSR functions will revert due to safety checks to prevent overflow.

### **Attacker's Actions**

#### **1. Initial Market State**

Let's assume the market currently has the following vote counts:

```solidity
markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = 100,000;     // Current trust votes
markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = 50,000;   // Current distrust votes
```

- The current `trustVotes` are below the maximum safe limit of `133,000`.

#### **2. Calculating Votes Needed to Exceed Safe Limit**

The attacker wants to exceed the safe limit for `trustVotes`. They calculate the number of votes needed:

```solidity
votesToBuy = (maxSafeVotesPerSide + 1) - currentTrustVotes;
// votesToBuy = (133,000 + 1) - 100,000 = 33,001 votes
```

By purchasing `33,001` additional trust votes, the attacker will push `trustVotes` to `133,001`, exceeding the safe limit by `1` vote.

#### **3. Executing the Attack**

The attacker proceeds to purchase the calculated number of votes:

```solidity
// Attacker calls buyVotes to purchase 33,001 trust votes
reputationMarket.buyVotes{value: totalCost}(
    profileId,
    true,         // isPositive = true (buying trust votes)
    33_001,       // votesToBuy
    minVotesToBuy // Minimum acceptable votes (for slippage protection)
);
```

After this transaction, the updated vote counts are:

```solidity
markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = 100,000 + 33,001 = 133,001 trust votes
markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = 50,000;   // Unchanged distrust votes
```

This pushes the `trustVotes` over the maximum safe limit.

#### **4. Resulting Denial-of-Service**

With `trustVotes` now at `133,001`, any subsequent LMSR calculations involving `trustVotes` will revert due to overflow checks in the LMSR library.

### Mitigation

Before allowing a vote purchase, check whether the new total votes would exceed the maximum safe votes.

  ```solidity
  function buyVotes(
      uint256 profileId,
      bool isPositive,
      uint256 maxVotesToBuy,
      uint256 minVotesToBuy
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
      _checkMarketExists(profileId);

      uint256 liquidityParameter = markets[profileId].liquidityParameter;
      uint256 maxSafeVotes = 133 * liquidityParameter;
      uint256 currentVotes = markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];
      uint256 newTotalVotes = currentVotes + maxVotesToBuy;

      // Ensure purchase does not exceed safe vote limit
      if (newTotalVotes > maxSafeVotes) {
          revert("Purchase exceeds maximum safe votes for this market");
      }

      // ... (rest of the function)
  }
  ```
