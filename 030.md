# Admin market removals will make users chose the wrong market

### Summary

All available markets are in an array of `marketConfigs`. Where each index has it's own unique config and users can have only 1 market with only 1 config. 

Admins can `addMarketConfig` and `removeMarketConfig`, however when doing an add the place of the last index would replace the current removed index passably causing a user to pick the wrong index if the change and market creation happens at the same time.

### Root Cause

`_createMarket` relying on indexes without any ''slippage/verification" check

```solidity
  function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
    uint256 marketConfigIndex
  ) private nonReentrant {
    // ensure a market doesn't already exist for this profile
    if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] != 0 || markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] != 0)
      revert MarketAlreadyExists(profileId);

    // ensure the specified config option is valid
    if (marketConfigIndex >= marketConfigs.length)
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Invalid config index");

    uint256 creationCost = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].creationCost;

    // Handle creation cost, refunds and market funds for non-admin users
    if (!hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
      if (msg.value < creationCost) revert InsufficientLiquidity(creationCost);
      marketFunds[profileId] = creationCost;
      if (msg.value > creationCost) {
        _sendEth(msg.value - creationCost);
      }
    } else {
      // when an admin creates a market, there is no minimum creation cost; use whatever they sent
      marketFunds[profileId] = msg.value;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User wants to create a luxurious market (good params + high `creationCost`)

### External Pre-conditions

1. Admin removes an index

### Attack Path

1. Famous user wants to create a deep market with lots of liquidity (it will be expensive)
2. He selects the 3rd index and calls `createMarketWithConfig`
3. At the same time an admin removes this config and `removeMarketConfig` replaces it with the last
4. The user TX executes second and his market is made with a cheap config (low `creationCost`) and bad parameters

Our user can only create 1 market and wasting this opportunity on the wrong config will mean that he would not use it.

### Impact

Users have only 1 market per ID, i.e. 1 market per actual user. Wasting this market on the wrong config would mean that this user will not be a part of ethos.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

While adding market push them to the array and while removing them instead of deleting each market and changing the array order, just mark it as un-usable and leave it there. This way the user TX would revert and he would be able to create a market with another config of his choice.
