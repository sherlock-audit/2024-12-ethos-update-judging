# Incorrect `updateDonationRecipient()` Function.

### Summary
There could be a situation where a user has multiple markets, leading to a loss of funds for the owner when updating the donation recipient.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L641

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
1. `Alice` registers with `profile1` and creates a market.
2. `Alice` is deleted from `profile1` and re-registers with `profile2`.
3. `Alice` receive the ownership of market in `profile2`.
    Now, `Alice` is reciving donations from 2 markets.
    Assuming that the donation amount from `profile1` is `2e18`, and the donation amount from `profile2` is `1e18`.
4. `Alice` is going to transfer ownership to `Bob`, who in `profile1`.
    At this time, `Alice` should send the ownership and `2e18`.
    However, in L641, all of `Alice`'s `3e18` are sent to `Bob`.
    
### Impact
Loss of funds.

>* @notice Deleted addresses can be re-registered to any profile.

As you can see, the deleted address can be re-registered to any profile as long as it is not marked as Compromised.
The `EthosProfile.sol` is implemented this way.

```solidity
ReputationMarket.sol
        function updateDonationRecipient(
            uint256 profileId,
            address newRecipient
        ) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
            if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

            // if the new donation recipient has a balance, do not allow overwriting
            if (donationEscrow[newRecipient] != 0)
            revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Donation recipient has balance");

            // Ensure the sender is the current donation recipient
            if (msg.sender != donationRecipient[profileId]) revert InvalidProfileId();

            // Ensure the new recipient has the same Ethos profileId
            uint256 recipientProfileId = _ethosProfileContract().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(newRecipient);
            if (recipientProfileId != profileId) revert InvalidProfileId();

            // Update the donation recipient reference
            donationRecipient[profileId] = newRecipient;
            // Swap the current donation balance to the new recipient
641:        donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender];
642:        donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
            emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, msg.sender, newRecipient);
        }
```

### Mitigation
Consider using both the recipient and profileId as parameters for the donationEscrow. This ensures that funds are correctly attributed to the specific profile and recipient combination, preventing potential loss of funds.
