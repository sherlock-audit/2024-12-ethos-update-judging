# Markets that have been created with the removed Market Config will keep on selling and buying votes

### Summary

`removeMarketConfig()` allows the owner to controle the :
liquidity, basePrice, creationCost
the issue is that the already created market will keep existing, this may lead to a critical issues
as a malicious user could abuse the removed liquidity parameter, which makes it possible to drain funds 
from the market

### Root Cause

1. if the owner updates the `MarketConfig.liquidity` for a critical reason
2. with the price going up and down the `MarketConfig.liquidity` parameter could be an issue in the calculation, and there is no mechanism that's allow the owner to control existing markets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Using a Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR), vote prices fluctuate dynamically based on demand, when the demand is high the code is designed to allow the owner to update the `MarketConfig.liquidity` to prevent funds draining.
