# The contract can pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading

### Summary

The contract can pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading since [sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L539) doesn't check if the [two votes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L346C1-L347C44) added in the create function is maintained after selling.

### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket.sol` there is no check to ensures the following invariant to hold :
