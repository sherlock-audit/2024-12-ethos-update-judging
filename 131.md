# Denial of Service and Gas Inefficiency in buyVotes() Function

### Summary

The `buyVotes()` function in the `ReputationMarket` contract contains a while loop that adjusts the number of votes to be purchased (`currentVotesToBuy`) based on the user-provided `maxVotesToBuy` and the available `msg.value`. While this dynamic calculation ensures fairness, it introduces significant vulnerabilities when `maxVotesToBuy` is unreasonably high (given the premium configuration has a max buy/sell votes of 13,300,000) compared to what `msg.value` can afford.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the unconstrained while loop within the [buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440) function. The loop continues until `totalCostIncludingFees` isn't higher than the user's `msg.value`. 
If a user provides a very large `maxVotesToBuy` value that significantly exceeds what their `msg.value` can purchase, the loop will continue iterating unnecessarily, consuming excessive gas.

### Attack Path

An attacker or an uninformed user could exploit this vulnerability by:

1. Setup:
    * A user calls `buyVotes()` with `msg.value` sufficient for only 2 votes but sets `maxVotesToBuy` = 1,000,000.
2. Execution:
    * The loop iterates times, consuming excessive gas and possibly exhausting the block gas limit.
3. Result:
    * Transaction fails due to out-of-gas error, or the user incurs unreasonably high gas fees.
    * Other users might experience delayed transactions as blocks reach their gas capacity.

### Impact

1. User Gas Costs:
    * The user initiating the transaction faces excessive gas consumption, particularly for large values of `maxVotesToBuy`.
2. Denial of Service (DoS):
    * If the loop iterates excessively, it may cause the transaction to run out of gas, reverting the transaction. This effectively results in a DoS for the user attempting to buy votes.
3. System-Wide Gas Limitations:
    * Transactions with high gas costs can affect the network block limits, potentially delaying other transactions within the same block.
4. User-Driven Exploit:
    * Even though the vulnerability stems from user-provided inputs, its presence reflects a lack of protective measures in the protocol.

All  outcomes can result in a poor user experience, potential financial losses for users, and reduced contract functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this, you can add a check to ensure that the difference between `totalCostIncludingFees` and `msg.value` is within a reasonable range before entering the loop. This way, you can prevent the loop from running excessively and consuming too much gas.
