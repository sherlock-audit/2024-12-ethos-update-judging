# Rounding Errors in Price Calculation May Violate LMSR Invariant

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract is designed to maintain the LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) invariant that the sum of the prices of "trust" and "distrust" votes equals the `basePrice`. However, due to inconsistent and improper rounding in the `_calcVotePrice` function, this invariant can be violated. The function applies rounding methods that, in certain scenarios, cause the sum of the calculated prices to be less than 1.

### Root Cause


## **Broken Invariant**

From the contract's documentation:

> **Must maintain LMSR invariant (yes + no price sum to 1)**

---


- **Incorrect Rounding in Price Calculation:**

  The `_calcVotePrice` function calculates the price of trust and distrust votes using the odds multiplied by the `basePrice`. However, it applies rounding inconsistently and opposite to the intended way, as per the comments in the code.

```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
      // odds are in a ratio of N / 1e18
      uint256 odds = LMSR.getOdds(
          market.votes[TRUST],
          market.votes[DISTRUST],
          market.liquidityParameter,
          isPositive
      );
      // multiply odds by base price to get price; divide by 1e18 to get price in wei
      // round up for trust, down for distrust so that prices always equal basePrice
      return
          odds.mulDiv(
              market.basePrice,
              1e18,
              isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
          );
  }
  ```

  - **Inconsistent Rounding:**

    - The comment says:

      > "round up for trust, down for distrust so that prices always equal basePrice"

    - However, in the code:

      - For **trust** votes (`isPositive == true`), it uses `Math.Rounding.Floor` (rounds down).
      - For **distrust** votes (`isPositive == false`), it uses `Math.Rounding.Ceil` (rounds up).

    This is the opposite of what the comment indicates and what is needed to ensure the prices sum to `basePrice`.

- **Violation of Invariant Due to Rounding Errors:**

  Because of the incorrect rounding, the sum of `trustPrice` and `distrustPrice` may become less than the `basePrice`. This violates the invariant that the sum must always equal `basePrice`.

### Impact

Because of the incorrect rounding, the sum of `trustPrice` and `distrustPrice` may become less than the `basePrice`. This violates the invariant that the sum must always equal `basePrice`.

### PoC

**Market Parameters:**

- `trustVotes = 1000`
- `distrustVotes = 2000`
- `basePrice = 1 ether` (1e18 wei)
- `liquidityParameter = 1000`

### **Calculating Odds**

Using the `LMSR.getOdds` function:

```solidity
uint256 oddsTrust = LMSR.getOdds(
    trustVotes,          // 1000
    distrustVotes,       // 2000
    liquidityParameter,  // 1000
    true                 // isPositive = true for trust votes
);

uint256 oddsDistrust = LMSR.getOdds(
    trustVotes,          // 1000
    distrustVotes,       // 2000
    liquidityParameter,  // 1000
    false                // isPositive = false for distrust votes
);
```

Assuming `getOdds` function returns odds in UD60x18 format (scaled by 1e18). Suppose the calculated odds are:

- `oddsTrust = 268941421369995120` (approximately 0.2689 * 1e18)
- `oddsDistrust = 731058578630004880` (approximately 0.7310 * 1e18)

### **Calculating Prices**

Using the `_calcVotePrice` function:

```solidity
// Calculating trust price
uint256 trustPrice = oddsTrust.mulDiv(
    basePrice,             // 1 ether
    1e18,
    Math.Rounding.Floor    // Since isPositive is true, uses Floor (should be Ceil as per the comment)
);

// Calculating distrust price
uint256 distrustPrice = oddsDistrust.mulDiv(
    basePrice,             // 1 ether
    1e18,
    Math.Rounding.Ceil     // Since isPositive is false, uses Ceil (should be Floor as per the comment)
);
```

**Values after Calculation:**

- **Trust Price:**

  ```solidity
  trustPrice = (268941421369995120 * 1e18) / 1e18 = 268941421369995120 wei (no rounding needed)
  ```

- **Distrust Price:**

  ```solidity
  distrustPrice = (731058578630004880 * 1e18 + (1e18 - 1)) / 1e18 = 731058578630004881 wei (rounding up)
  ```

### **Summing Prices**

```solidity
uint256 sumPrices = trustPrice + distrustPrice;
// sumPrices = 268941421369995120 + 731058578630004881 = 999999999999999999 wei
```

**Expected Sum:**

- `basePrice = 1 ether = 1e18 wei`

**Difference:**

- `basePrice - sumPrices = 1e18 - 999999999999999999 = 1 wei`

### **Violation of Invariant**

The sum of `trustPrice` and `distrustPrice` is less than `basePrice` by `1 wei`, thereby violating the invariant that the sum must equal `basePrice`.

### **Cause of the Violation**

- The incorrect rounding directions applied in the `_calcVotePrice` function cause this discrepancy.
- By rounding **down** for `trustPrice` and **up** for `distrustPrice`, the inevitable loss due to integer division accumulates, leading to a total sum less than `basePrice`.

### Mitigation

To fix the issue and ensure the sum of the prices always equals `basePrice`, the rounding directions in the `_calcVotePrice` function should be corrected to match the intention stated in the comment:

- **Round up for trust votes and round down for distrust votes.**

### **Corrected Code:**

```solidity
function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    // odds are in a ratio of N / 1e18
    uint256 odds = LMSR.getOdds(
        market.votes[TRUST],
        market.votes[DISTRUST],
        market.liquidityParameter,
        isPositive
    );
    // multiply odds by base price to get price; divide by 1e18 to get price in wei
    // round up for trust, down for distrust so that prices always equal basePrice
    return
        odds.mulDiv(
            market.basePrice,
            1e18,
            isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Ceil : Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
}
```
