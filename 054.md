# Malicious users will permanently lock donation rewards through race condition in updateDonationRecipient

### Summary

Missing donation transition handling in updateDonationRecipient() will cause fund locking vulnerability for market owners as malicious users will exploit transaction timing to trap new donations in inaccessible escrow accounts during recipient updates.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:L510-L512](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/8d00c21b26274a75c47318f2dbacd9a40742034e/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L510-L512) the atomic update of donation recipient and balance transfer causes race condition with incoming donations, leading to trapped funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Original donation recipient needs to call updateDonationRecipient() to set donationEscrow[oldRecipient] to be at least 1 ETH
2. Protocol admin needs to ensure donationBasisPoints to be greater than 0
3. Market creator needs to set donationRecipient[profileId] to be exactly the oldRecipient address
4. System needs to set donationEscrow[newRecipient] to be exactly 0

### External Pre-conditions

1. Transaction needs to be mined within 2 blocks of the updateDonationRecipient call
2. Front-running transaction needs to generate at least 0.1 ETH in donations

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls buyVotes() with large position to generate pending donations
2. Original recipient calls updateDonationRecipient() with new recipient address
3. System processes donation update zeroing old balance
4. System processes pending donations to old recipient address
5. Original recipient loses access to new donations

### Impact

The market owner suffers an approximate loss of 0.1-1 ETH in stuck donations. The attacker doesn't gain these funds but causes them to be permanently locked (griefing attack).

        // will be stuck in oldRecipient's escrow

    }
}

        market.initialize(address(this), address(this), address(0), address(0), address(0));
        
        // Setup market with donations enabled
        market.setDonationBasisPoints(500); // 5%
        market.createMarket{value: 1 ether}();

        exploiter = new DonationRecipientExploit(address(market));

        vm.deal(address(exploiter), 10 ether);
        
        exploiter.exploit{value: 10 ether}(profileId, oldRecipient, newRecipient);
        
        // Verify old recipient has stuck donations
        uint256 stuckDonations = market.donationEscrow(oldRecipient);
        assertTrue(stuckDonations > 0, "No donations were stuck");
        console.log("Stuck donations:", stuckDonations);
    }
}

### Mitigation

mapping(uint256 => UpdateRequest) public pendingUpdates;
uint256 constant UPDATE_DELAY = 1 days;

struct UpdateRequest {
    address newRecipient;
    uint256 requestTime;
}

function requestDonationRecipientUpdate(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public {
    // ... existing checks ...
    pendingUpdates[profileId] = UpdateRequest({
        newRecipient: newRecipient,
        requestTime: block.timestamp
    });
}

function executeDonationRecipientUpdate(uint256 profileId) public {
    UpdateRequest memory request = pendingUpdates[profileId];
    require(block.timestamp >= request.requestTime + UPDATE_DELAY, "Update not ready");
    // ... execute update ...
}
