# Missing Validation for creationCost in addMarketConfig

### Summary

The addMarketConfig function does not validate the creationCost parameter, allowing configurations to be added with a creationCost of 0. [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L366](url)

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket::addMarketConfig` there is no sanity check for 0 creationCost value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users can ceateMarkets at no cost if they use a MarketConfig whose creationCost was not set or is zero.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a check to revert if creationCost is zero
if (creationCost == 0) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Creation cost cannot be zero");
