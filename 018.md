# Unbounded Growth of `participants[profileId]` Array

### **Summary and Impact**



https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440-L497


The `ReputationMarket` smart contract exhibits an unbounded growth vulnerability within the `participants[profileId]` array. Specifically, every time a user buys votes, their address is appended to the `participants` array without any mechanism to remove or manage existing entries. Over time, especially for popular profiles, this array can grow excessively large. 

**Impact:**
- **Gas Consumption:** As the `participants` array grows indefinitely, any future on-chain operations that involve iterating over this array will become increasingly gas-intensive. This can lead to transactions exceeding block gas limits, rendering certain functionalities unusable.
- **Performance Degradation:** Operations dependent on the size of the `participants` array will suffer in performance, potentially affecting user experience and contract reliability.
- **Future Vulnerabilities:** An oversized array may introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities or make the contract susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where malicious actors exploit the high gas costs to disrupt contract functionality.

This vulnerability is classified as **Medium** because, while it does not directly result in financial loss or immediate contract failure, it poses significant risks to the scalability and future usability of the contract.

### **Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerability stems from the unbounded growth of the `participants[profileId]` array within the `ReputationMarket` contract. Each time a user interacts with the market (e.g., buying votes), their address is added to the `participants` array without any checks to prevent duplicates or mechanisms to remove addresses that no longer hold votes.

#### **Code Snippet**

```solidity
// ReputationMarket.sol

// Adding a new participant
participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
```

These lines are located within functions that handle vote purchases, such as `buyVotes`.

#### **Test Code Snippet**

```solidity

function testUnboundedParticipantGrowth() public {
    // Step 1: Create a new market for mockProfileId
    vm.deal(address(this), 1 ether);
    reputationMarket.createMarketWithConfig{value: 0.2 ether}(0);

    // Step 2: Have user1 buy votes -> This should add user1 to participants
    vm.deal(user1, 1 ether);
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    reputationMarket.buyVotes{value: 0.01 ether}(mockProfileId, true, 1, 1);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 3: Have user2 buy votes -> This should add user2
    vm.deal(user2, 1 ether);
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    reputationMarket.buyVotes{value: 0.01 ether}(mockProfileId, true, 1, 1);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 4: Have user3 buy & then sell
    vm.deal(user3, 1 ether);
    vm.startPrank(user3);
    reputationMarket.buyVotes{value: 0.01 ether}(mockProfileId, false, 1, 1);
    // Sell everything
    reputationMarket.sellVotes(mockProfileId, false, 1, 0); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Check participant count
    uint256 participantCount = reputationMarket.getParticipantCount(mockProfileId);
    console.log("Participant Count after user1, user2, user3 (who sold all):", participantCount);

    // Assert that participantCount is 3
    assertEq(participantCount, 3, "Participant array should have 3 addresses total.");
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Market Creation:** A new reputation market is created for a mock profile ID.
2. **User Interactions:**
   - `user1` buys votes, resulting in their address being added to the `participants` array.
   - `user2` similarly buys votes, adding their address.
   - `user3` buys and then sells all their votes. Despite selling, their address remains in the `participants` array.
3. **Verification:** The test asserts that the `participants` array contains all three users, demonstrating that even after selling all votes, participants are not removed, leading to unbounded growth.

### **Recommendations**

To mitigate the unbounded growth of the `participants[profileId]` array, the following strategies should be implemented:

 **Participant Removal Mechanism:**
   - Implement functionality to remove a participant from the `participants` array when they no longer hold any votes. This can be triggered when a user sells all their votes.
   - **Considerations:**
     - Removing elements from an array in Solidity can be gas-intensive. To optimize, consider using a mapping with an enumerable set or indexing system.
     - Alternatively, maintain an off-chain record of participants and avoid on-chain enumerations entirely.
