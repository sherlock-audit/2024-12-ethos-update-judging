# Slippage Protection on Sell votes is implemented incorrectly

## Summary
The Slippage Protection uses `proceedsBeforeFees` instead of `proceedsAfterFees`, which makes user get paid for vote with price less than intended

## Description
When users sell there votes they provide a minimum price per vote to protect themselves from slippage and price changes. This is made by getting the number of votes that the user will sell, and then divide the total price of them to the number of the votes he sold, to represent an average price of each vote. Then this value is compared against the one provided by the user.

The problem is that when selling votes, there is an exit fees is taken from the amount we took so `proceedsBeforeFees` is greater than `proceedsAfterFees` in that case, and the user takes `proceedsAfterFees` amount.

```solidity
  function sellVotes( ... ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    (uint256 proceedsBeforeFees, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 proceedsAfterFees) = _calculateSell( ... );

>>  uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
    if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
      revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
    }
// -------------------------------
  function _calculateSell( ... ) ... {
    ...
    proceedsBeforeFees = _calcCost(market, isPositive, false, votesToSell);
>>  (proceedsAfterFees, protocolFee) = previewExitFees(proceedsBeforeFees);
  }
// -------------------------------
  function previewExitFees(
    uint256 proceedsBeforeFees
  ) private view returns (uint256 totalProceedsAfterFees, uint256 protocolFee) {
    protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
>>  totalProceedsAfterFees = proceedsBeforeFees - protocolFee;
  }
```

`proceedsBeforeFees` represents the total amount we will subtract from the market, but `proceedsAfterFees` represent the exact amount the user will take. And in the slippage check we are comparing the value against `proceedsBeforeFees` which will make the price of each votes gets calculated with a value greater than the value that will be given to the user.

## Proof of Concept
- userA bought 10 Votes
- userA wants to sell these 10 votes where each vote should give him at least `100`
- userA fired `sellVotes` and made `minimumVotePrice` equals `100`
- Votes are getting Sold
- Protoolc Exit Fees are `3%`
- Decreasing these `10` votes gives the total amount of `1000`. i.e: proceedsBeforeFees` equals 1000
- `proceedsAfterFees` will be `proceedsBeforeFees * 3%` = 970
-  Doing a Slippage check uses `proceedsBeforeFees` which is `1000` so `1000 / 10` equals `100` which makes the slippage check passes
- Sending the money for that `10` votes to the user by sending him `proceedsAfterFees` which is `970`
- The actual average price of the vote the user takes is `970 / 10` i.e `97` instead of `100`
- The user takes less than he intended because the slippage check considers protocol fees too.

## Recommendations
Implement the slippage check using `proceedsAfterFees` instead of `proceedsBeforeFees`
