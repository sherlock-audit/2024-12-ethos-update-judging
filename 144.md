# Wrong rounding direction will lead to user can't sell the last votes in the market due to underflow

### Summary

Wrong rounding direction in `_calcCost()` will lead to the user not being able to sell the last votes in the market due to underflow

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1057

This calculation has wrong rounding:
```solidity
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
      isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );
```
Instead of rounding in favor of the protocol (aka rounding up when user buying, rounding down when user selling), the calculation will round down when buying/selling TRUST vote, and round up when buying/selling DISTRUST vote


### Internal Pre-conditions
1. Admin creates a market with no/very small amount of creation cost
2. The base price of that market is mildly odd, which makes room for rounding 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The initial market will be: vote of `TRUST=1`, vote of `DISTRUST=1`, `basePrice = 1.111e18`, `liquidation parameter = 100`, `marketFunds = 0` because the admin can create markets with 0 amount of ether cost
2. User A buy 100 DISTRUST -> `_calcCost() = 68083609502231759384 ~ 68.08e18` -> `marketFund = 68083609502231759384`
3. User A sell 9 DISTRUST -> `_calCost() = 7200065779706726078 ~ 7.2e18` -> `marketFund = 68083609502231759384 - 7200065779706726078 = 60883543722525033306`
4. User A sell 11 DISTRUST -> `_calCost() = 7200065779706726078 ~ 7.2e18` ->`marketFund = 60883543722525033306 - 8548283373986344155= 52335260348538689151`
5. User A sell 80 DISTRUST, drain the whole market -> `_calCost() = 52335260348538689152 ~ 52.33e18` -> `marketFund = 52335260348538689151 - 52335260348538689152 = -1`. Because marketFund is uint256 type, the transaction revert
6. Instead, user A sell 79 DISTRUST -> `_calCost() = 51778371604325108785 ~ 51.78e18` -> `marketFund = 52335260348538689151 - 51778371604325108785 =  556888744213580366` -> not reverted 

### Impact

As a result, user A can't sell the last DISTRUST vote, leading to losing ~0.55e18 ETH

### PoC

_No response_

```diff
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
-     isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
+     !isBuy ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
