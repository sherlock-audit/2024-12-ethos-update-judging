# Rounding Arbitrage (Different Rounding for Trust vs. Distrust)

### Summary

An attacker will systematically extract a small profit at the expense of the market’s liquidity (i.e., other users and overall contract funds) by exploiting rounding differences between trust and distrust trades.

in the `_calcCost()` and `_calcVotePrice()` functions, the code uses:
- Floor rounding (Math.Rounding.Floor) when dealing with trust
- Ceiling rounding (Math.Rounding.Ceil) when dealing with distrust

This asymmetry in rounding can let a savvy trader buy trust votes slightly cheaper (due to floor) and sell distrust votes slightly higher (due to ceil) or vice versa.

Impact
This leads to arbitrage opportunities for attackers, who can flip trades repeatedly to accumulate a net profit while draining a portion of the protocol’s funds over time.



### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol, specifically in _calcCost():

```solidity

cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
  market.basePrice,
  1e18,
  isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
);
```

Similarly, in _calcVotePrice():

```solidity

return odds.mulDiv(
  market.basePrice,
  1e18,
  isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
);
```
Because the code “floors” one side and “ceils” the other, small discrepancies arise each time a user switches between buying trust and selling distrust (or vice versa). An attacker can harness these small differences repeatedly to gain at the expense of the contract’s liquidity.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1-Market is active, with some marketFunds[profileId] value available.
2-There is no additional fee or mechanism that offsets or negates frequent small trades.
3-Both trust and distrust sides are non-zero, allowing trading back and forth.


### External Pre-conditions

1-The attacker must have on-chain capital to repeatedly buy and sell.
T2-here are no external constraints preventing rapid or consecutive trades (e.g., no block-based cooldown, no protocol-enforced slippage limit, etc.).


### Attack Path

1-Attacker starts with some ETH and no votes.

2-Attacker buys a small amount of trust votes, benefiting from floor rounding. They pay slightly less than the ideal “fair cost.”

3-Immediately sells the same amount of distrust votes (via some swap logic, possibly by first flipping the trust to distrust in partial 
trades or performing a sell to realize the price difference), getting the benefit of ceil rounding on the proceeds.

4-The attacker repeats this cycle. Each time, they net a tiny arbitrage gain.

5-Accumulated over many quick transactions, these gains can drain the contract’s marketFunds by a non-trivial amount, effectively stealing from the shared liquidity pool (the sum of all initial or continuing deposits).

### Impact

Affected Party:
- All current or future participants in that market, because the contract’s overall liquidity is diminished by the arbitrage.
- Over time, the market’s balancing mechanism keeps paying out slightly more on one side than it takes in on the other.

Attacker Gain:
A direct ETH profit, potentially unbounded if they can keep cycling trades without a significant fee or limit.

### PoC

pseudo-code snippet illustrating repeated trading to exploit rounding:

```solidity

// NOTE: This is conceptual pseudocode; 

function testRoundingArbitrage(ReputationMarket rm, uint256 profileId) public {
    // Suppose attacker has initial 100 ETH
    // Step 1: Buy 1 trust vote, paying an “undercost” due to floor rounding
    // Step 2: Sell that “1 trust vote” or convert to distrust in a quick step,
    //         receiving an “overpay” due to ceil rounding.

    // We'll do the loop multiple times:
    for (uint i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        // 1. buyVotes(profileId, isPositive=true, maxVotesToBuy=1, minVotesToBuy=1);
        // 2. sellVotes(profileId, isPositive=false, votesToSell=1, minimumVotePrice=0);
    }

    // Expect to see the attacker’s ETH balance increment by a small margin each cycle.
}
```
In practice, the exact procedure might involve carefully computing the partial trades so that the attacker systematically flips from trust to distrust (or vice versa) while capturing rounding differences. Over many iterations, the pool loses a measurable amount of ETH.

### Mitigation

1-Use a Consistent Rounding Mode
Either floor for both sides or ceil for both sides, or unify the rounding in a single place so that trust + distrust are symmetrical.

2-Adjust the Logic
Perform the precise UD60x18 math before rounding once at the end, instead of applying different rounding modes depending on the side.

3-Add a Small Fee that surpasses the typical rounding difference.
- If there is a minimal spread or transaction fee higher than the rounding gap, repeated flipping becomes unprofitable.

4-Rate-limit or impose a small cooldown on trades to reduce repeated micro-arbitrage.
