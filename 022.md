# Slippage in sellVotes() should be calculated based on proceedsAfterFees instead of proceedsBeforeFees

## Description
The slippage in `sellVotes()` is [calculated based on `proceedsBeforeFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L553-L556):
```js
 @-->   uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
             if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
                 revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
             }
```

The seller is going to ultimately receive `proceedsAfterFees` and hence would base his expectations on that. Here's a simple example:
1. `proceedsBeforeFees` is 6 ether
2. `protocolFee` is 2 ether
3. `proceedsAfterFees = 6 - 2 = 4 ether`
4. Seller sold 1 vote and specified `minimumVotePrice` as `5 ether`, which he expects to receive in his account
5. Protocol compared : `Is 6 < 5? No; so it's safe to continue`. 
6. Seller gets `4 ether` in his account even though he had specified `minimumVotePrice` as `5 ether`.

## Mitigation
```diff
-   uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
+   uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsAfterFees/ votesToSell : 0;
    if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
      revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
    }
```
