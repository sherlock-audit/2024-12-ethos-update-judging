# Missing Slippage checks in `buyVotes` function

### Summary

The `buyVotes` function fails to validate that the final adjusted vote count (`currentVotesToBuy`) remains above the specified `minVotesToBuy` after the dynamic adjustment loop. This allows a purchase to complete with fewer votes than the user expects, violating the slippage protection intended by the `minVotesToBuy` parameter.


### Root Cause

In the `buyVotes` function, while there is a `minVotesToBuy` parameter, it only validates that the ETH provided (`msg.value`) is sufficient to cover the cost of `minVotesToBuy` votes::
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440)
```js
uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
    revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
}
```
However, this does not ensure that the final adjusted vote count (`currentVotesToBuy`) after the loop still satisfies `minVotesToBuy`. If the buyer initially specifies a high `maxVotesToBuy`, the dynamic adjustment loop may decrement the votes to a value below `minVotesToBuy` due to insufficient funds.
```js
while (totalCostIncludingFees > msg.value) {
    currentVotesToBuy--;
    (purchaseCostBeforeFees, protocolFee, donation, totalCostIncludingFees) = _calculateBuy(
        markets[profileId],
        isPositive,
        currentVotesToBuy
    );
}
```
Here, no validation after loop if `currentVotesToBuy >= minVotesToBuy`.

Without a subsequent check, itâ€™s possible for `currentVotesToBuy` to fall below `minVotesToBuy`, contradicting the user's expectation of receiving at least `minVotesToBuy` votes.

### Impact

Users may receive fewer votes than expected

### Mitigation

Add a post-loop validation:
```js
if (currentVotesToBuy < minVotesToBuy) revert SlippageExceeded();
```
