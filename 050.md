# Improper Use of `getRoleMember` in `updateOwner` May Lead to Incorrect Owner Role Revocation

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract, which inherits from `AccessControl`, uses the `updateOwner` function to transfer ownership. This function relies on `getRoleMember(OWNER_ROLE, 0)` to identify the current owner for role revocation. However, the `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable` contract from OpenZeppelin specifies that role members are not stored in any particular order, and their ordering may change. This means that `getRoleMember(OWNER_ROLE, 0)` may not reliably return the current owner (`msg.sender`), leading to improper revocation of the owner role from unintended addresses. This can result in ownership mismanagement, unauthorized access, or loss of control over sensitive functions in the `ReputationMarket` contract.

### Root Cause

the `updateOwner` function is implemented as follows:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L106C1-L109C4


```solidity
function updateOwner(address owner) external onlyOwner {
    _revokeRole(OWNER_ROLE, getRoleMember(OWNER_ROLE, 0));
    _grantRole(OWNER_ROLE, owner);
}
```

This function assumes that:

1. There is only one address with the `OWNER_ROLE`.
2. The owner is always at index `0` in the list of role members.

However, the `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable` contract (from OpenZeppelin) used by `AccessControl` manages role members using an `EnumerableSet`, which does not guarantee any specific ordering of elements. The relevant part of the OpenZeppelin code is:

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Returns one of the accounts that have `role`. `index` must be a
 * value between 0 and {getRoleMemberCount}, non-inclusive.
 *
 * Role bearers are not sorted in any particular way, and their ordering may
 * change at any point.
 *
 * WARNING: When using {getRoleMember} and {getRoleMemberCount}, make sure
 * you perform all queries on the same block. See the following
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/iterating-over-elements-on-enumerableset-in-openzeppelin-contracts/2296[forum post]
 * for more information.
 */
function getRoleMember(bytes32 role, uint256 index) public view virtual returns (address) {
    AccessControlEnumerableStorage storage $ = _getAccessControlEnumerableStorage();
    return $._roleMembers[role].at(index);
}
```

The key point is that **"Role bearers are not sorted in any particular way, and their ordering may change at any point."**

Therefore, using `getRoleMember(OWNER_ROLE, 0)` does not reliably return the current owner (`msg.sender`). If multiple addresses have the `OWNER_ROLE`, the address at index `0` may not be the caller. This can lead to revoking the owner role from an unintended address.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. **Multiple Owners**: Assume multiple addresses hold the `OWNER_ROLE` due to prior role assignments.
2. **Ownership Transfer Attempt**: An owner (`Owner1`) calls `updateOwner(newOwnerAddress)` to transfer ownership.
3. **Incorrect Role Revocation**: The function revokes the `OWNER_ROLE` from the address at index `0`, which might not be `Owner1`, but another owner (`Owner2`).
4. **Ownership Mismanagement**:
   - `Owner1` still retains the `OWNER_ROLE`.
   - `Owner2` loses the `OWNER_ROLE` unexpectedly.
   - The new owner (`newOwnerAddress`) gains the `OWNER_ROLE`.
5. **Potential Unauthorized Access**: Unintended addresses may retain owner privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive functions in `ReputationMarket`, such as upgrading the contract via `_authorizeUpgrade`:

   ```solidity
   function _authorizeUpgrade(
       address newImplementation
   ) internal override onlyOwner onlyNonZeroAddress(newImplementation) {
       // Intentionally left blank to ensure onlyOwner and zeroCheck modifiers run
   }
   ```

---

### Impact


- **Ownership Mismanagement**: Ownership transfer may not work as intended, leading to multiple owners or loss of control by the intended owner.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Addresses that should no longer have the `OWNER_ROLE` may retain it, allowing them to perform sensitive operations.

### PoC


1. **Setup**: Two addresses, `Owner1` and `Owner2`, hold the `OWNER_ROLE`:

   ```solidity
   // Both Owner1 and Owner2 have been granted OWNER_ROLE
   ```

2. **Ownership Transfer Attempt**: `Owner1` tries to transfer ownership to `NewOwner`:

   ```solidity
   reputationMarket.updateOwner(newOwnerAddress);
   ```

3. **Function Execution in `AccessControl`**:

   ```solidity
   function updateOwner(address owner) external onlyOwner {
       // Revokes OWNER_ROLE from the address at index 0 (could be Owner2)
       _revokeRole(OWNER_ROLE, getRoleMember(OWNER_ROLE, 0));
       _grantRole(OWNER_ROLE, owner); // Grants OWNER_ROLE to NewOwner
   }
   ```

4. **Outcome**:

   - `Owner2` (at index `0`) loses the `OWNER_ROLE`.
   - `Owner1` retains the `OWNER_ROLE`.
   - `NewOwner` gains the `OWNER_ROLE`.
   - This results in `Owner1` and `NewOwner` both having the `OWNER_ROLE`, which may not be intended.

5. **Resulting Issues**:

   - `Owner1` did not lose their owner privileges.
   - `Owner2` lost ownership unintentionally.
   - Potential for unauthorized actions by unintended owners.


### Mitigation

Modify the `updateOwner` function to revoke the `OWNER_ROLE` from the caller (`msg.sender`) instead of using `getRoleMember`:

   ```solidity
   function updateOwner(address owner) external onlyOwner {
       _revokeRole(OWNER_ROLE, msg.sender);
       _grantRole(OWNER_ROLE, owner);
   }
   ```

   This ensures that the owner transferring ownership loses their privileges, and the new owner gains them.
