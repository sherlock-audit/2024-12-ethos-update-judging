# Slippage Protection Ineffectiveness in Vote Purchase Adjustment

### Summary

The while loop adjusting the number of votes `currentVotesToBuy` fails to enforce slippage protection effectively, allowing purchases to complete with fewer votes than the user-specified minimum `minVotesToBuy`. This can violate user expectations and expose the system to front-running, market manipulation, or griefing attacks.

### Root Cause

Logic Flaw: The absence of an explicit check for `currentVotesToBuy < minVotesToBuy` after cost adjustments allows transactions to finalize even when the user's minimum purchase requirement is not met.
Loop Behavior: The loop decreases `currentVotesToBuy` until the cost fits within `msg.value` without considering whether the adjusted votes still respect the user's preferences.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`_calculateBuy` Behavior: Returns valid but slightly decreasing costs for votes near the user’s intended purchase.
Loop Implementation: Adjusts `currentVotesToBuy` without verifying against `minVotesToBuy`.
Lack of Post-Loop Validation: Final checks for `minVotesToBuy` are missing.

### External Pre-conditions

User-Supplied Parameters:
`msg.value` insufficient for the initial desiredVotesToBuy.
`minVotesToBuy` > achievable votes given `msg.value`.
Volatile Market Conditions:
Changes in market state (e.g., fees, slippage) during transaction execution.


### Attack Path

1. Initial State:

Target Transaction:
`msg.value` = 5 ETH
`minVotesToBuy` = 100
Market liquidity low.
Initial Calculation:
Cost of 100 votes ≈ 4.9 ETH (meets conditions).

2. Attacker Action:

Front-runs the transaction by purchasing 200 votes.
New Cost of 100 votes = 5.2 ETH (exceeds `msg.value`).

3. Target Transaction Outcome:

while loop adjusts `currentVotesToBuy` downward until 90 votes are affordable.
`minVotesToBuy` = 100 is ignored, and the transaction finalizes with 90 votes.

### Impact

An attacker manipulates market conditions to reduce affordable votes below `minVotesToBuy`.
Bad actors exploit the gap between intended and received votes to gain an unfair advantage.
Malicious users repeatedly create conditions that violate others' `minVotesToBuy` thresholds, forcing failed transactions.

### PoC

A user submits a transaction with:

`msg.value` = 5 ETH.
desiredVotesToBuy = 100.
`minVotes`ToBuy = 90.
The `_calculateBuy` function computes:

Cost for 100 votes = 5.5 ETH (exceeds `msg.value`).
The loop decrements `currentVotesToBuy` iteratively.
At currentVotesToBuy = 89, `_calculateBuy` computes a total cost under 5 ETH.

The transaction completes with 89 votes, violating the `minVotesToBuy` = 90 condition.

### Mitigation

Add Post-Loop Validation
Ensure the transaction reverts if `currentVotesToBuy` falls below `minVotesToBuy`.

     if (currentVotesToBuy < minVotesToBuy) {
         revert("Current votes to buy fall below minimum allowed.");
     }
