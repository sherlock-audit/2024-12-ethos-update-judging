# Fee inconsistency between buying and selling results in inaccurate fees collected

### Summary
Currently, fees between selling and buying are taken differently. When buying, fees are based on just the buying amount, while when selling, their based on the entire amount.

```solidity
  function previewEntryFees(
    uint256 fundsBeforeFees
  ) private view returns (uint256 totalCostIncludingFees, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation) {
    protocolFee = (fundsBeforeFees * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    donation = (fundsBeforeFees * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    totalCostIncludingFees = fundsBeforeFees + protocolFee + donation;
  }
```

```solidity
  function previewExitFees(
    uint256 proceedsBeforeFees
  ) private view returns (uint256 totalProceedsAfterFees, uint256 protocolFee) {
    protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    totalProceedsAfterFees = proceedsBeforeFees - protocolFee;
  }
```

In other words, if a user wants to buy votes worth 1 ETH, and fee is 5%, user would have to pay 1.05 ETH, which makes the actual fee 4.76%
However, when selling tokens worth 1 ETH, and the fee is again 5%, they'd receive 0.95 ETH. In this case, the 5% fee is correct.



### Root Cause
Wrong math calculation 

### Affected Code

### Impact
Wrong fee taken

### Mitigation
Change the formula when calculating fees when buying.
