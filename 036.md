# An admin misconfiguration will cause a DoS for all market users

### Summary

The lack of validation in `setProtocolFeeAddress` will cause a complete denial-of-service (DoS) for all market participants as an admin can set `protocolFeeAddress` to a non-payable contract, making fee transfers revert and halting core functionalities.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#L1093](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L924C1-L934C57) the function `applyFees` immediately sends ETH to `protocolFeeAddress`. However, in `setProtocolFeeAddress`, there is no validation to ensure the new address can receive ETH. This omission allows admins to accidentally configure a non-payable address, causing all subsequent fee transfers to fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls `setProtocolFeeAddress` with a contract address that cannot receive ETH (e.g., no payable fallback).
2. The protocol sets `protocolFeeAddress` to this invalid address without any checks.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The admin sets `protocolFeeAddress` to a non-payable contract via `setProtocolFeeAddress`.
2. A user calls `buyVotes` or `sellVotes`, triggering the `applyFees` function.
3. `applyFees` attempts to send ETH to the invalid `protocolFeeAddress`, reverting the transaction.
4. All subsequent fee-based operations fail, causing a complete DoS.

### Impact

The entire protocol is effectively shut down for fee-based operations because transactions will revert when sending ETH to the invalid address. Users cannot buy or sell votes, and the market is unusable until the admin corrects the address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Validate the address:** Ensure `protocolFeeAddress` is capable of receiving ETH. One approach is to test-send a minimal amount of ETH before finalizing the change.
2. **Batch Fee Collection:** Accumulate fees in the contract, then allow periodic manual withdrawal by the admin. Even if the withdrawal address fails, it wonâ€™t break user-facing functionality.
