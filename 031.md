# Wrong rounding direction will cause initial liquidity drained

### Summary

The wrong rounding direction in `_calcCost()` will drain market liquidity during regular trading operations.

### Root Cause

In [`ReputationMarket.sol:1057`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1057) rounding direction is determined based on the value of `isPositive` flag. The mistake is that `isPositive` is `true` for the TRUST votes and `false` for DISTRUST votes. That means that rounding direction is dictated by the vote's type the `_calCost()` function processes at the moment, which is wrong. Rounding must always favor the protocol: round up when a user buys votes, and round down when a user sells votes back.

The statements below illustrate current `_calcCost()` behaviour:
- User buys  TRUST votes    => Rounding.Floor (WRONG: less cost paid)
- User sells TRUST votes    => Rounding.Floor (FINE)
- User buys  DISTRUST votes => Rounding.Ceil (FINE)
- User sells DISTRUST votes => Rounding.Ceil (WRONG: higher cost refunded)


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Users buy and sell votes.

### Impact

The reputation market suffers from a liquidity drain.

The following invariant is broken:
>The contract must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading. 

### PoC

Insert this test into ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.market.test.ts

```typescript
  it('poc_01', async () => {
    const profileId = ethosUserB.profileId;

    await reputationMarket
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .addMarketConfig(100n, ethers.parseEther('.001'), DEFAULT.creationCost);

    const marketConfigIndex = (await reputationMarket.getMarketConfigCount()) - 1n;

    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setUserAllowedToCreateMarket(profileId, true);

    await reputationMarket
      .connect(userB.signer)
      .createMarketWithConfig(marketConfigIndex, { value: DEFAULT.creationCost });

    let funds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(profileId);
    console.log(`Market funds (initial state)       : ${funds}`);

    // buy positive votes
    const votes = 50n;

    for (let i = 0; i < votes; i++) {
      await userA.buyVotes({ profileId, votesToBuy: 1n });
      funds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(profileId);
    }

    console.log(`Market funds after buying ${votes} votes : ${funds}`);

    await userA.sellVotes({ profileId, sellVotes: votes });
    funds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(profileId);
    console.log(`Market funds after selling ${votes} votes: ${funds}`);
  });
```

Output:
```bash
$ npx hardhat test --grep poc_01


  ReputationMarket
Market funds (initial state)       : 1000000000000000000
Market funds after buying 50 votes : 1028092980362016112
Market funds after selling 50 votes: 999999999999999975
    âœ” poc_01 (1191ms)


  1 passing (3s)
```


### Mitigation

In the `_calcCost()`, determine rounding direction based on `costRatio` sign:

```solidity
    uint256 positiveCostRatio = costRatio > 0 ? uint256(costRatio) : uint256(costRatio * -1);
    // multiply cost ratio by base price to get cost; divide by 1e18 to apply ratio
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
--    isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
++    costRatio < 0 ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );
```
