# `isParticipant` is not cleared when selling all votes

### Summary

When a user buys some votes, he's added to the participants array and `isParticipant` map, this indicates that the user holds some votes for that market.
```solidity
// Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
  participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
  isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
}
```

When the user sells his votes he is expected to be removed from the map but remains in the participants' arrays, this could be confirmed by:
1. "append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.", https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L131-L133.
2. "@\return The number of historical participants (includes addresses that sold all votes)", https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L782-L790.

However, this does not happen when the user sells all his votes, and `isParticipant` will keep showing true.

### Root Cause

`isParticipant` is not cleared after selling all the user's votes, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L539-L578.

### Impact

`isParticipant` is not cleared after selling all the user's votes, which still indicates that he holds some votes, even though he doesn't.

### PoC

Add the following test in `ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.fees.test.ts`:
```typescript
describe('PoC', () => {
  let user1: HardhatEthersSigner, user2: HardhatEthersSigner;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    user1 = ethosUserA.signer;
    user2 = await deployer.createUser().then(async (ethosUser) => {
      await ethosUser.setBalance('2000');

      return ethosUser.signer;
    });

    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setExitProtocolFeeBasisPoints(5_00);
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(5_00);
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(5_00);
  });

  it('isParticipant not clearing when selling votes', async () => {
    // User 1 buys 1 vote
    await reputationMarket
      .connect(user1)
      .buyVotes(DEFAULT.profileId, true, 1, 1, { value: DEFAULT.creationCost });

    // User 1 is added as a participant
    expect(await reputationMarket.isParticipant(DEFAULT.profileId, user1.address)).to.be.equal(
      true,
    );

    // User 1 sells 1 vote
    await reputationMarket.connect(user1).sellVotes(DEFAULT.profileId, true, 1, 0);

    // User 1 is still a participant
    expect(await reputationMarket.isParticipant(DEFAULT.profileId, user1.address)).to.be.equal(
      true,
    );
  });
});
```

### Mitigation

Clear `isParticipant` when a seller sells all his votes, by adding something like the following in `sellVotes`:
```solidity
if (votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] == 0) {
  // remove the participant if they've sold all their votes
  isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
}
```
