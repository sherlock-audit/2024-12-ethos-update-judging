# Users can participate in Markets without buying votes

## Summary
There is no prevention for the less number of votes to buy, allows user to participate in the market without paying any funds.

## Description
Users can provide `0` amount of votes/disVotes to buy, this will allow users to participate in the Market of that profile without buying any votes/disVotes.

[ReputationMarket.sol#L440-L456](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440-L456)
```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 maxVotesToBuy,
    uint256 minVotesToBuy
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    // preliminary check to ensure this is enough money to buy the minimum requested votes.
    (, , , uint256 total) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, minVotesToBuy);
    if (total > msg.value) revert InsufficientFunds();

    (
      uint256 purchaseCostBeforeFees,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 totalCostIncludingFees
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, maxVotesToBuy);
    uint256 currentVotesToBuy = maxVotesToBuy;
    ...
    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
>>    participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }
    ...
  }
```

There is no check if `mind/maxVotesToBuy` are zero or not. In case they are provided as `zero` all funds to be paid by the user will be zero, which will allow users to participate in a given Profile market without sending any eth or even buying any vote/disVote.

## Impacts
- Participate in different profile markets without sending any money
- Make a sybil attack by participating in the same profile market with different addresses, making `participants` array for that profile market too huge. This can affect protocol integrats with ReputationMarket as viewing the full array can cause OOG this time. and Ethos is a complete system working together and there are some parts like `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL`
- In the last of the buying we fire `_emitMarketUpdate`, which updates `lastMarketUpdates` by the block.number, and the current market state. Having `block.number` equals the current block, will make the update time updates continuously even when no votes/disVotes changing occuar.

This will affect the protocol data where participants can contain users that do not even buy any vote from that market anytime.

## Recommendations
Make `buyVotes()` forces at least on vote/disVote to buy.
