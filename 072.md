# Improper Validation in `updateDonationRecipient` function Allows Loss of User Funds

### Summary

The `updateDonationRecipient` function in the `reputationMarket.sol` lacks proper validation to prevent a user `(msg.sender)` from setting themselves as the `newRecipient.` This oversight, combined with hardcoding `donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0,` allows for the complete loss of the userâ€™s donation balance.



### Root Cause

In [`updateDonationRecipient`,](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L621-L644) the function lacks a critical validation check to prevent `msg.sender` from setting themselves as the `newRecipient.` This leads to the following sequence of issues:

In `ReputationMarket.sol:621-644`
There is no check to ensure `msg.sender != newRecipient.`

In `RepuationMarket.sol:642`, the balance of `msg.sender` is hardcoded to 0 after the transfer `(donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0),` leading to a loss of funds if the `newRecipient` is the same address as `msg.sender.`



### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The user intends to change their donation recipient, but due to a lack of validation, they mistakenly set their own address `(msg.sender)` as the `newRecipient.` In this case, the contract will not prevent the user from setting themselves as the recipient.



### Impact

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent users from setting their own msg.sender address as the new recipient
