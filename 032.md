# Incorrect Cost Calculation in `sellVotes` Allows Withdrawal of Excess Funds

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract contains an error in the cost calculation within the `sellVotes` function. Specifically, when calculating the proceeds from selling votes, the contract incorrectly handles negative cost differences by taking the absolute value, which can lead to users withdrawing more funds than they should receive. This miscalculation occurs because the `_calcCost` function ignores the sign of the cost difference (`costDiff`), leading to proceeds being incorrectly treated as positive even when they should be negative.

### Root Cause

In the `_calcCost` function, the cost difference (`costRatio`) calculated by the `LMSR.getCost` function can be negative when selling votes. However, `_calcCost` takes the absolute value of `costRatio` without considering whether it's a gain or a loss, resulting in incorrect cost calculations.

  ```solidity
  int256 costRatio = LMSR.getCost(
      market.votes[TRUST],
      market.votes[DISTRUST],
      voteDelta[0],
      voteDelta[1],
      market.liquidityParameter
  );

  uint256 positiveCostRatio = costRatio > 0 ? uint256(costRatio) : uint256(-costRatio);

  // Multiply cost ratio by base price to get cost
  cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
      isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
  );
  ```

In the `sellVotes` function, the proceeds before fees (`proceedsBeforeFees`) are calculated using `_calcCost`, which, due to the absolute value handling, returns a positive value even when `costRatio` is negative. This leads to users potentially receiving funds from the contract when they should actually be paying into the market.

  ```solidity
  proceedsBeforeFees = _calcCost(market, isPositive, false, votesToSell);
  ```
  The incorrect calculation results in `marketFunds[profileId]` being decreased by the (incorrectly positive) `proceedsBeforeFees`, which can cause the contract's total balance to fall below the correct amount, violating financial invariants and potentially leading to loss of funds.

### Attack Path


An attacker can exploit this flaw by selling votes in a scenario where the cost difference (`costDiff`) is negative. Due to the absolute value handling in `_calcCost`, the proceeds are incorrectly calculated as a positive amount, allowing the attacker to receive ETH from the contract when they actually should be paying into it.

**Example Steps:**

1. **Market Manipulation:**
   - The attacker manipulates the market to create conditions where selling their votes results in a negative `costDiff`. This could involve purchasing a large number of opposing votes to shift the market state.

2. **Initiate Exploit:**
   - The attacker calls `sellVotes` to sell their votes.

3. **Incorrect Proceeds Calculation:**
   - The `_calcCost` function computes `costRatio` as negative due to the market state but then converts it to a positive value using the absolute value, leading to an incorrect positive `proceedsBeforeFees`.

4. **Withdrawal of Excess Funds:**
   - The attacker receives ETH from the contract, withdrawing more funds than appropriate and potentially draining the contract's balance.

### Impact

The attacker receives ETH from the contract when they should have been required to pay, improperly withdrawing funds.

### PoC

### **Initial Market State**

Assume the following initial state of the market:

- **Market Parameters:**
  ```solidity
  uint256 yesVotes = 2000;
  uint256 noVotes = 1000;
  uint256 liquidityParameter = 1000;
  uint256 basePrice = 1 ether;
  ```

- **Attacker's Holding:**
  ```solidity
  uint256 attackerYesVotes = 1000; // Attacker owns 1000 "yes" votes
  ```

### **Market Manipulation**

The attacker manipulates the market to create a condition where selling their "yes" votes results in a negative cost difference.

- **Market Shift:**
  - The attacker (or colluding parties) buys additional "no" votes to significantly change the market dynamics.
  - **New Market State:**
    ```solidity
    yesVotes = 2000;
    noVotes = 5000; // Increased from 1000 to 5000
    // The attacker's holdings remain the same
    ```

### **Exploit Execution**

The attacker proceeds to sell their "yes" votes by calling the `sellVotes` function.

```solidity
// Attacker calls sellVotes to sell 1000 "yes" votes
reputationMarket.sellVotes(
    profileId,      // The profile ID of the market
    true,           // isPositive = true (selling "yes" votes)
    1000,           // votesToSell
    0               // minimumVotePrice (set to 0 for simplicity)
);
```

### **Incorrect Proceeds Calculation**

Within the `sellVotes` function, the proceeds are calculated using the `_calcCost` function, which improperly handles negative cost differences.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Calculate Proceeds Before Fees:**

   ```solidity
   proceedsBeforeFees = _calcCost(market, isPositive, false, votesToSell);
   ```

2. **Inside `_calcCost`:**

   - **Determine Vote Delta for Selling Votes:**
     ```solidity
     // Since isPositive is true and isBuy is false, we are selling "yes" votes
     voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST] - amount;    // Updated "yes" votes
     voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST];          // "No" votes remain the same
     ```

     After selling:
     ```solidity
     voteDelta[0] = 2000 - 1000 = 1000;
     voteDelta[1] = 5000;
     ```

   - **Calculate Cost Difference Using LMSR:**
     ```solidity
     int256 costRatio = LMSR.getCost(
         market.votes[TRUST],           // Current "yes" votes: 2000
         market.votes[DISTRUST],        // Current "no" votes: 5000
         voteDelta[0],                  // Updated "yes" votes: 1000
         voteDelta[1],                  // Updated "no" votes: 5000
         market.liquidityParameter      // Liquidity parameter: 1000
     );
     ```

   - **In LMSR.getCost Function:**
     The cost difference (`costDiff`) is calculated as:
     ```solidity
     costDiff = newCost - oldCost;
     ```
     Because the market has shifted significantly, `newCost` is less than `oldCost`, resulting in a negative `costDiff`.

   - **Incorrect Absolute Value Handling:**
     ```solidity
     uint256 positiveCostRatio = costRatio > 0 ? uint256(costRatio) : uint256(-costRatio);
     ```

     Here, even though `costRatio` is negative, taking the absolute value makes `positiveCostRatio` positive.

   - **Calculate Cost:**
     ```solidity
     cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
         market.basePrice,  // basePrice = 1 ether
         1e18,
         isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
     );
     ```

     This results in a positive `cost`, which is incorrect because the cost difference should be negative.

3. **Back to `sellVotes`:**

   - **Proceeding with Incorrect Proceeds:**
     ```solidity
     proceedsBeforeFees = /* incorrect positive value */;
     ```

   - **Calculate Fees:**
     Fees are calculated based on the incorrectly positive `proceedsBeforeFees`.

   - **Update Market Funds and User's Vote Holdings:**
     ```solidity
     markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] -= votesToSell;     // Deduct sold votes
     votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] -= votesToSell;

     marketFunds[profileId] -= proceedsBeforeFees;       // Decrease market funds incorrectly
     ```

   - **Transfer Funds to Attacker:**
     ```solidity
     _sendEth(proceedsAfterFees);  // Attacker receives ETH
     ```

### **Outcome**

As a result of the incorrect cost calculation:

- The attacker receives ETH from the contract when, in reality, they should have paid ETH into the market due to the negative cost difference.
- The contract's `marketFunds` decreases improperly, potentially leading to a deficit.
- This allows the attacker to withdraw excess funds from the contract.

### Mitigation

Modify the `_calcCost` function to return an `int256` representing the actual cost difference, preserving its sign, and adjust the calculation accordingly.

  ```solidity
  function _calcCost(
      Market memory market,
      bool isPositive,
      bool isBuy,
      uint256 amount
  ) private pure returns (int256 cost) {
      // Calculate the vote delta
      uint256[] memory voteDelta = new uint256[](2);
      if (isBuy) {
          // ... existing logic ...
      } else {
          // ... existing logic ...
      }

      // Get the cost difference from the LMSR
      int256 costRatio = LMSR.getCost(
          market.votes[TRUST],
          market.votes[DISTRUST],
          voteDelta[0],
          voteDelta[1],
          market.liquidityParameter
      );

      // Multiply cost ratio by base price to get cost
      cost = int256(market.basePrice).mulDiv(
          costRatio,
          1e18
      );
  }
  ```

- **Adjust Calling Functions to Handle Negative Proceeds:**

  In the `sellVotes` function, check if the `proceedsBeforeFees` is negative. If it is, handle the case appropriately, such as requiring the seller to pay into the market or preventing the sale.

  ```solidity
  int256 proceedsBeforeFees = _calcCost(market, isPositive, false, votesToSell);
  if (proceedsBeforeFees <= 0) {
      // The seller should not receive funds; optionally, they may need to pay in
      revert InvalidSellOperation("Proceeds cannot be negative");
  }

  uint256 proceeds = uint256(proceedsBeforeFees);

  // Proceed with fee deductions and ETH transfer
  ```
