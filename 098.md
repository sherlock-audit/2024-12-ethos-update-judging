# Rounding bias prevalent when buying and selling trust and distrust votes

### Summary

As evident from the lines [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1054C5-L1058C7) we can see that there is clear bias in rounding off direction based on the vote type.

Current situation:

Buy TRUST Vote: Round down
Sell TRUST Vote: Round down

Buy DISTRUST Vote: Round up
Sell DISTRUST Vote: Round up

This will impact how buying and selling decisions are made and overall the value these votes hold.


### Root Cause

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1054C5-L1058C7) in the `_caclCost` function, the rounding direction is decided based on vote type.

In addition to that there is implicit rounding down that happens for all cases by default in [LMSR.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/LMSR.sol) because of using the PRB math library

A distrust vote is treated separately from a trust vote when it comes to incentivizing buying and selling of those votes.

### Impact

The choice to decide the rounding direction based on the vote type will cause the following problems as a result of not rounding the prices in favor of the protocol. i.e Round Up for Buy and Round down for Sell (which is recommended practice)

* Since TRUST votes always round down, that means if the price of a trust vote increases by a small amount (not passing the next whole number in the integer line) then the buyer can take advantage of this and buy the vote of the increased price at the same old rate.  

* Since DISTRUST votes always round up, that means if the price of distrust vote decreases by a small amount the seller can take advantage of this when he/she changes their mind and decide to sell it back to the protocol at the same old price when it was more valuable.
