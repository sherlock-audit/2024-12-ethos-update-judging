# Using Non-Upgradeable ReentrancyGuard in Upgradeable Contractarty

### Summary

Using non-upgradeable ReentrancyGuard in an upgradeable contract can cause storage collisions and reentrancy vulnerabilities, potentially allowing attackers to drain funds through reentrancy attacks.

### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket.sol` the contract inherits from non-upgradeable ReentrancyGuard while being upgradeable:
```solidity
contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuard, ITargetStatus {
```

Non-upgradeable ReentrancyGuard uses fixed storage slot that conflicts with proxy pattern:
```solidity
// ReentrancyGuard (non-upgradeable)
uint256 private _status; // Fixed slot 0

// vs ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable 
bytes32 private constant ReentrancyGuardStorageLocation; // Namespaced slot
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Storage collisions between ReentrancyGuard._status and proxy storage
- Potential reentrancy vulnerabilities in those functions buyVotes(), sellVotes(), withdrawDonations()

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable instead 
```solidity 
contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, ITargetStatus {
    function initialize(
        address owner,
        address admin,
        address expectedSigner,
        address signatureVerifier,
        address contractAddressManagerAddr
    ) external initializer {
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __accessControl_init(
            owner,
            admin,
            expectedSigner,
            signatureVerifier,
            contractAddressManagerAddr
        );
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        // ...existing code...
    }
}

```
