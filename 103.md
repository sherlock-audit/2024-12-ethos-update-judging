# Prices of TRUST vote and DISTRUST vote do not sum up to 1 when basePrice >= 1 ether

### Summary

A main invariant of the protocol is that the addition of TRUST vote price and DISTRUST vote price must always be equal to market's basePrice. However, this only happens when market is totally balanced (TRUST votes amount = DISTRUST votes amount) as the price of each vote is the half of basePrice. Whenever there are more votes of one type than the other, prices will not add up to 1 (basePrice).

### Root Cause

This happens due to the way prices are calculated. To get the price of a TRUST/DISTRUST vote in a given market, firstly odds of that vote in that market are calculated in 1e18 format; then the final price is calculated as odds * basePrice / 1e18, rounded down when vote is TRUST and up when it is DISTRUST.

As a result, the addition of both vote prices will be equal to a value close to basePrice, but lower if the basePrice >= 1 ether. The remaining to reach basePrice depends on basePrice itself. Examples (tested in Remix):
TRUST votes = 5, DISTRUST votes = 7, liquidity = 20, basePrice = 1 ether. TRUST vote price = 475020812521060013, DISTRUST vote price = 524979187478939986, sum of both prices = 999.999.999.999.999.999 (should be 1e18, equal to basePrice).

TRUST votes = 5, DISTRUST votes = 7, liquidity = 20, basePrice = 10 ether. TRUST vote price = 4750208125210600130, DISTRUST vote price = 5249791874789399860, sum of both prices = 9.999.999.999.999.999.990 (should be 10e18, equal to basePrice).

This difference is due to the fact that rounding is made in the final operation, instead of in getOdds() function, which would make the sum equal to 1 in all cases as requested by the invariant. For the same examples as above, these are the odds:

TRUST votes = 5, DISTRUST votes = 7, liquidity = 20. TRUST vote odds = 475020812521060013, DISTRUST vote odds = 524979187478939986, sum of both odds = 999.999.999.999.999.999 (should be 1e18, equal to 100%). As odds do not up to 100%, the sum of TRUST and DISTRUST prices neither will do.

### Impact

One of the main invariant of the protocols is broken because of a rounding number issue. As long as a market with basePrice >= 1 ether has more votes of one kind than the other TRUST and DISTRUST vote prices will not add up to basePrice.

### Mitigation

Apply the rounding of decimals in getOdds() function so that both odds add up to 100% and both prices add up to the basePrice.

One idea could be to always calculate odds of TRUST vote, which is rounding down by default and in case that DISTRUST vote is being checked use ```1e18 - odds of TRUST vote```, which would automatically return the value rounded up. Use these values to get each vote's price, which will add up to basePrice.
