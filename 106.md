# Exceeding maximum address limit

### Summary

In the contract EthosProfile there is a misconfigured condition (if (maxAddresses > 2048) instead of if (maxAddresses > 128)) will cause an unintended increase in the allowed number of addresses for contract users, as the contract will permit more addresses than intended, leading to potential gas wastage, instability, and incorrect behavior. This issue may result in significant disruptions in the contract's functionality, including excessive gas costs, incorrect resource distribution, and the potential for security vulnerabilities if the contract's logic relies on limiting the number of addresses.

  ```
function setMaxAddresses(uint256 maxAddresses) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    maxNumberOfAddresses = maxAddresses;
    if (maxAddresses > 2048) { // must be 128
      revert MaxAddressesReached(0);
    }
  }
```


### Root Cause

In the contract, a misconfiguration on line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L792 (if (maxAddresses > 2048)) leads to an unintended number of addresses being allowed, when the actual limit should be 128 as made in the initialize function on line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/c3a2b007d0ddfcb476f300f8b766808f0e3e2dfd/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L151

### Attack Path

1. Administrator calls the function that changes the maximum number of addresses (e.g., setMaxAddresses()), setting a value greater than 128 (e.g., 2048).
2. User calls the registration function (e.g., registerProfile()), which is now no longer restricted by the initial maximum number of addresses due to the new configuration.
3. Since the check for the maximum number of addresses (if (maxAddresses > 128)) was bypassed by the administrator's change, the user can register a new profile even if the number of registered addresses exceeds the originally intended limit.
4. The attacker or any other user can now create multiple new profiles, bypassing the system's previous restrictions on the number of allowed addresses.

### Impact

The change in the maximum address limit will allow users to register new profiles beyond the intended limit. This creates an opportunity for abuse, where an attacker or any user could create an excessive number of profiles, potentially overwhelming the system, distorting data, or causing the contract to behave unexpectedly.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Changing the 2048 to 128 will resolve this issue  
  ```
function setMaxAddresses(uint256 maxAddresses) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    maxNumberOfAddresses = maxAddresses;
  +  if (maxAddresses > 128) { 
      revert MaxAddressesReached(0);
    }
  }  ```
