# Malicious actors will steal funds through vote price manipulation sandwiching

### Summary

Insufficient slippage time validation in sellVotes() will cause financial loss for traders as attackers will sandwich vote sales with large opposing trades to manipulate execution prices.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:L333-L336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/8d00c21b26274a75c47318f2dbacd9a40742034e/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L333-L336) the slippage check occurs before state updates and doesn't account for sandwich attacks through the LMSR curve manipulation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Market needs to have total votes to be at least 1000 per side
2. Liquidity parameter needs to be set to default 100
3. Market needs to be active (not graduated
4. Target seller needs to own at least 100 votes

### External Pre-conditions

1. Network must allow same-block transaction ordering (MEV)
2. Gas price needs to allow for profitable sandwich execution

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors mempool for sellVotes transactions
2. Attacker identifies victim sell transaction with minimumVotePrice
3. Attacker front-runs with large buy to push price up
4. Victim transaction executes with manipulated price check
5. Attacker back-runs with large sell to profit from price movement

### Impact

The traders suffer an approximate loss of 20-50% on their sell transactions due to price manipulation. The attacker gains this spread minus gas costs through the sandwich attack.

uint256 constant MIN_BLOCKS_BETWEEN_TRADES = 5;

modifier enforceTradeDelay() {
    require(
        block.number >= lastTradeBlock[msg.sender] + MIN_BLOCKS_BETWEEN_TRADES,
        "Must wait minimum blocks between trades"
    );
    _;
    lastTradeBlock[msg.sender] = block.number;
}

function sellVotes(...) public enforceTradeDelay {
