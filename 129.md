# Zeroed-Out "Zombie" Markets

### Summary

A sequence of traders (including potentially malicious users) will lock a market into an inaccessible state for everyone by driving both trust and distrust votes to zero, leaving residual funds stuck.

The contract’s _checkMarketExists() function reverts if both markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0 and markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0. Once a market’s vote counts reach (0, 0), all further interactions (buy or sell) revert. This effectively becomes a “zombie” market: it can’t be used, even though marketFunds[profileId] might still hold ETH.

Impact
This causes a permanent lock for users, as no one can re-populate the market with new votes (the check reverts). Any leftover ETH remains trapped until/unless an authorized entity graduates or forcefully manages the market.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol,` _checkMarketExists():

```solidity

function _checkMarketExists(uint256 profileId) private view {
    if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0 && markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0)
        revert MarketDoesNotExist(profileId);
}
```
Any function calling _checkMarketExists(profileId) (e.g., buyVotes(), sellVotes(), simulateBuy(), etc.) will revert if the votes are (0,0). There is no re-creation or re-initialization path for a zeroed-out market.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1-The market has small enough total votes that it’s possible for users to fully sell all trust and all distrust votes.
2-No logic or check prevents both sides from going to zero simultaneously.


### External Pre-conditions

1-Traders systematically sell (or burn) all trust votes and all distrust votes.
2-The market is not graduated and still has marketFunds[profileId] > 0 left behind.

### Attack Path

1-A user sees the market has (x, y) trust/distrust votes.
2-They and others sell until x and y become 0 and 0.
3- _`checkMarketExists(`) triggers revert MarketDoesNotExist(...) for any new `buyVotes()` call. Thus, no one can “reopen” the market by buying again.
4- If the graduation function is never invoked, the leftover marketFunds[profileId] can become stuck indefinitely.

(Though not a direct “theft,” it’s a scenario that denies further usage or retrieval by normal participants.)

### Impact

Affected Party:
- All potential market participants hoping to keep trading or to reinitiate a zeroed market.
- Potential leftover liquidity that remains locked if the official graduation contract never calls withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds().

Result:
- Denial of Service for future trades.
- Possible indefinite lock of any remaining ETH in `marketFunds[profileId]`.

contract ZombieMarketTest is Test {
    ReputationMarket rm;

    function setUp() public {
        rm = new ReputationMarket();
        // Assume some initialization & market creation, so
        // markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = 1, markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = 1
        // marketFunds[profileId] = 1 ether
    }

    function testZeroedOutMarket() public {
        // Suppose user sells the last TRUST vote
        // now trust votes = 0
        // Another user sells the last DISTRUST vote
        // now distrust votes = 0 => combined = (0,0)

        // Any call that checks _checkMarketExists(profileId) reverts:
        vm.expectRevert(ReputationMarketErrors.MarketDoesNotExist.selector);
        rm.buyVotes{value: 0.1 ether}(profileId, true, 1, 1);

        // leftover funds remain in marketFunds[profileId], but no normal path to reclaim them 
        // unless the official "graduateMarket" => "withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds" is triggered 
        // by the authorized address.
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1-Automatically Graduate when (trustVotes, distrustVotes) == (0, 0).
Once both sides are zero, call graduateMarket(profileId) internally, allowing an official withdrawal flow.

2-Allow Re-Initialization
Provide an explicit function for an admin or the original market owner to “revive” a zeroed market by setting (1,1) again.

3-Prohibit Simultaneous Zeroing
Revert any sell that would make a side go zero if the other side is already zero (though this might be too restrictive for legitimate trades).
