# Malicious actors will block market graduations through precision-based race conditions

### Summary

Lack of minimum notice period in market graduation will cause denial of service for market participants as malicious actors will manipulate graduation timing to trap user funds through precision-based race conditions.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:L605-L607](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/8d00c21b26274a75c47318f2dbacd9a40742034e/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L605-L607) the market graduation executes immediately without a waiting period, allowing abrupt state changes that can trap user transactions in flight.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Market owner needs to set market state to be active (not graduated)
2. Market needs to have total funds to be at least 1 ETH
3. Authorized graduation contract needs to be set in contractAddressManager

### External Pre-conditions

1. Market graduation transaction needs to be mined within same block as user trade
2. Trade transaction needs to involve at least 0.1 ETH in value

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors mempool for large market trades
2. Attacker identifies pending trade transaction
3. Authorized contract calls graduateMarket() targeting same block
4. Market graduates before trade completes
5. User transaction fails due to market state change

### Impact

The traders suffer an approximate loss of gas fees (0.01-0.05 ETH per failed transaction). The attacker doesn't gain these funds but disrupts market operations (griefing).

        assertTrue(marketFunds > 0, "Market should have trapped funds");
        
        console.log("Trapped funds in market:", marketFunds);
    }
}

### Mitigation

mapping(uint256 => uint256) public graduationNotices;
uint256 constant GRADUATION_NOTICE_PERIOD = 1 days;

function announceGraduation(uint256 profileId) public {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName("GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL");
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) revert UnauthorizedGraduation();
    
    graduationNotices[profileId] = block.timestamp;
    emit GraduationAnnounced(profileId);
}

function graduateMarket(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    require(
        graduationNotices[profileId] > 0 &&
        block.timestamp >= graduationNotices[profileId] + GRADUATION_NOTICE_PERIOD,
        "Graduation notice period not elapsed"
    );
    
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName("GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL");
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) revert UnauthorizedGraduation();

    graduatedMarkets[profileId] = true;
    emit MarketGraduated(profileId);
