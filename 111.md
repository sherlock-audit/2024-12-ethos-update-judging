# Removing a market configuration may result in the creation of a market with an unexpected configuration.

### Summary
When creating a market, the creator choose the index of market configuration. And, a market configuration can be removed at any time when not paused. If the chosen market configuration is removed right before creating the market, the market will be created with an unexpected configuration.  

### Root Cause
When creating a market, the creator choose the index of market configuration.

```solidity
  function createMarketWithConfig(uint256 marketConfigIndex) public payable whenNotPaused {
    uint256 senderProfileId = _getProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    // Verify sender can create market
    if (enforceCreationAllowList && !creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId])
      revert MarketCreationUnauthorized(
        MarketCreationErrorCode.PROFILE_NOT_AUTHORIZED,
        msg.sender,
        senderProfileId
      );

    _createMarket(senderProfileId, msg.sender, marketConfigIndex);
  }
```

And, a market configuration can be removed at any time when not paused.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L388-L405
```solidity
  function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    // Cannot remove if only one config remains
    if (marketConfigs.length <= 1) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Must keep one config");

    // Check if the index is valid
    if (configIndex >= marketConfigs.length) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("index not found");

    emit MarketConfigRemoved(configIndex, marketConfigs[configIndex]);

    // If this is not the last element, swap with the last element
    uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
400:  marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    }

    // Remove the last element
    marketConfigs.pop();
  }
```
As L400, if the index of the removed configuration is not the last one, the last market configuration will have the index instead of the original one. 
If the chosen market configuration is removed right before creating the market and the creation cost of the newly chosen market is not larger than that of the original market, the market will be created with an unexpected configuration.
This issue is not an user mistake because the user does not know when the configuration will be removed.
This issue is also not an admin issue because the admin does not know when the configuration will be used. 

### Internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path
none

### Impact
A market can be created with an unexpected configuration.

### PoC

### Mitigation
A market configuration must be allowed to be removed only when paused.
