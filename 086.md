# Missing Validation for creationCost in Market Configuration

### Summary

The `addMarketConfig` function lacks a validation check to ensure that the `creationCost` parameter is greater than or equal to the minimum required `creationCost`. This omission can lead to an exploit where an admin sets the `creationCost` to 0, bypassing the intended cost mechanism.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:366](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L366), there is a missing validation check to ensure that the `creationCost` parameter is greater than or equal to the minimum required `creationCost`.

### Attack Path

- An admin creates a premium market configuration with a `creationCost` of 0.
- An approved user leverages this configuration to create a market at no cost (`creationCost` = 0).
- Since the market is premium (characterized by less price fluctuation), it attracts user activity, leading to increased `donationFee` earnings for the approved user.
- The approved user benefits disproportionately by earning `donationFee` on user transactions within the market at no `creationCost`. 

### Impact

- Deviation from the intended economic model of the system.
- As users buy or sell votes, the approved user earns `donationFee` at no `creationCost`. 
- Funds in `marketFunds` mapping will comprise only users who bought votes for the market.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a validation check in the `addMarketConfig` function to ensure that `creationCost` is greater than or equal to the minimum acceptable `creationCost`.
