# Incorrect rounding in the `_calcCost` function.

### Summary
Rounding must be in favor of the protocol. In the `_calcCost` function, however, rounding is incorrectly applied, which could lead to a DoS of subsequent market actions.

### Root Cause
In the `_calcCost` function, rounding is done based on `isPositive`, which is not in favor of the protocol.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1054-L1058
```solidity
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
      isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
    );
```

And, the `marketFunds` of the market is updated by using the cost.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L480
```solidity
    marketFunds[profileId] += purchaseCostBeforeFees;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L561
```solidity
    marketFunds[profileId] -= proceedsBeforeFees;
```
So, a bit bigger amount can be reduced from `marketFunds`, if a buyer buys more than one `UNTRUST` votes at once and sells them individually. Because rounding up is done only once when buying, but more than one times of rounding up are done when selling them.
This may lead to a DoS for selling the last votes.

Consider the following scenario:
1. A market is created with 0 `createCost`.
2. Alice buys 10 `UNTRUST` votes at once.
3. Alice sells all of them by selling one vote at a time.

As a result, selling the last vote of the market can be DoSed due to overflow from rounding error.

This DoS is possible in two kind of markets, where the initial `marketFunds[profileId]` is 0.

First, markets created by an ADMIN has no minimum creation cost.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L341-L342
```solidity
      // when an admin creates a market, there is no minimum creation cost; use whatever they sent
      marketFunds[profileId] = msg.value;
```

Second, this DoS can well happen in markets with 0 `creationCost`, because there is no minimum check for creationCost.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L366-L382
```solidity
  function addMarketConfig(
    uint256 liquidity,
    uint256 basePrice,
    uint256 creationCost
  ) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
    if (liquidity < 100) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Min liquidity not met");

    if (basePrice < MINIMUM_BASE_PRICE) revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Insufficient base price");

    marketConfigs.push(
      MarketConfig({ liquidity: liquidity, basePrice: basePrice, creationCost: creationCost })
    );

    uint256 configIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    emit MarketConfigAdded(configIndex, marketConfigs[configIndex]);
    return configIndex;
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions
none

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
none

### Impact
Last vote of a market cannot be sold.

### PoC

### Mitigation
Rounding should be done based on `isBuy`.
```diff
    cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(
      market.basePrice,
      1e18,
-     isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil
+     isBuy ? Math.Rounding.Ceil : Math.Rounding.Floor
    );
```
