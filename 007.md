# Users can grief market graduation and make markets ungraduatable

### Summary

When checking for a market to be graduated, we use ```ReputationMarket.sol::_checkMarketExists()```. This way if the market creator has sold his votes, or is the last one to sell his votes, then the market becomes ungraduatable.

```solidity
function _checkMarketExists(uint256 profileId) private view {
    if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0 && markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0)
      revert MarketDoesNotExist(profileId);
}
```

As there is no check for votes becoming 0 when selling votes this is possible and may happen even unknowingly by users that are not aware of this limitation. 
Part of the `ReputationMarket.sol::sellVotes()` function:

```solidity
    (uint256 proceedsBeforeFees, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 proceedsAfterFees) = _calculateSell(
      markets[profileId],
      profileId,
      isPositive,
      votesToSell
    );

    uint256 pricePerVote = votesToSell > 0 ? proceedsBeforeFees / votesToSell : 0;
    if (pricePerVote < minimumVotePrice) {
      revert SellSlippageLimitExceeded(minimumVotePrice, pricePerVote);
    }

    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesToSell;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesToSell;
```

And in the `ReputationMarket.sol::_calculateSell()` function we have no check if votes after sell == 0.
Part of the `ReputationMarket.sol::_calculateSell()` function:
```solidity
uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];
    if (votesToSell > votesAvailable) revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);

    if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] < votesToSell)
      revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
```

### Root Cause

It is possible for a contract to be left out with 0 votes of `TRUST` and `DISTRUST` after selling of votes. This will lead to markets that [cannot be graduated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1065).
