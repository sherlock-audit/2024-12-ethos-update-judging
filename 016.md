# Liquidity Mismatch Leading to Potential Market Lock

### **Summary and Impact**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440-L497

The **Liquidity Mismatch** vulnerability in the `ReputationMarket` smart contract arises from improper handling of ETH funds during the purchase of votes. Specifically, when users execute the `buyVotes` function, the contract inaccurately tracks `marketFunds[profileId]` by adding the **pre-fee** purchase cost without accounting for the immediately deducted fees (protocol fees and donations). Over multiple transactions, this discrepancy causes `marketFunds` to reflect a higher value than the actual ETH balance held by the contract.

**Impact:**
- **Market Lock Potential:** As `marketFunds[profileId]` becomes increasingly inflated relative to the contract's real ETH balance, future attempts to sell votes (`sellVotes`) may fail. This is because the contract may not possess sufficient ETH to honor the withdrawal, causing transactions to revert.
- **User Experience Degradation:** Users attempting to sell their votes may face unexpected failures, undermining trust in the protocol's reliability.
- **Financial Implications:** Although funds are not directly stolen, the inability to sell votes can trap user funds within the market, leading to potential financial loss and reduced market liquidity.

While the vulnerability does not directly result in loss or theft of funds, the risk of market freeze and user inability to exit positions presents a significant operational concern, warranting a **Medium** severity classification.

### **Vulnerability Details**

The `ReputationMarket` contract's `buyVotes` function improperly updates the `marketFunds` mapping by adding the **gross** purchase cost before fees are deducted. This oversight leads to an imbalance between the tracked `marketFunds` and the actual ETH held by the contract. Over time, this mismatch can cause the contract to run out of ETH relative to the `marketFunds` recorded, preventing successful executions of the `sellVotes` function.

#### **Code Snippet**

```solidity
function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 maxVotesToBuy,
    uint256 minVotesToBuy
) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    // ... [omitted for brevity]

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += currentVotesToBuy;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += currentVotesToBuy;

    // Tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += purchaseCostBeforeFees; // Incorrect: Adds pre-fee amount

    // Distribute the fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // ... [omitted for brevity]
}
```

**Issue:**
- The line `marketFunds[profileId] += purchaseCostBeforeFees;` adds the total purchase cost **before** deducting fees.
- Subsequently, `applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);` deducts fees from the contract's ETH balance but does not adjust `marketFunds` accordingly.
- This results in `marketFunds[profileId]` being **greater** than the actual ETH available in the contract.

#### **Test Code Snippet**

```solidity
function testLiquidityMismatch() public {
    // Let user1 create a market for their profile
    vm.prank(user1);
    repMarket.createMarket{value: 2 ether}();

    // User2 performs multiple buys
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    repMarket.buyVotes{value: 1 ether}(profileIdUser1, true, 100, 50);
    repMarket.buyVotes{value: 1 ether}(profileIdUser1, true, 100, 50);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // User2 attempts to sell votes exceeding available ETH
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    vm.expectRevert();
    repMarket.sellVotes(profileIdUser1, true, 200, 0); // Expected to revert due to insufficient ETH
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Market Creation:** An admin (`user1`) creates a reputation market with an initial ETH deposit.
2. **Multiple Buys:** Another user (`user2`) buys votes twice, each time sending ETH that includes fees. However, `marketFunds` is incremented by the total purchase cost **before** fees are deducted.
3. **Sell Attempt:** When `user2` attempts to sell votes, the contract checks if `marketFunds` can cover the proceeds. Due to the earlier mismatch, the actual ETH balance may be insufficient, causing the transaction to revert and effectively locking the market.
