# Rounding will lead to broken invariant.

### Summary

`MarketConfig` values could cause incorrect rounding, leading to broken invariant.

### Root Cause

In [_calcCost](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1017) the `LMSR` library is used to calculate the cost ration the user has to pay. This ratio is multiplied by the base vote price using the `mulDiv` function. 
```solidity
function _calcCost(Market memory market, bool isPositive, bool isBuy, uint256 amount)
        private
        pure
        returns (uint256 cost)
    {
        // cost ratio is a unitless ratio of N / 1e18
        uint256[] memory voteDelta = new uint256[](2);
        // convert boolean input into market state change
        if (isBuy) {
            if (isPositive) {
                voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST] + amount;
                voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST];
            } else {
                voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST];
                voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST] + amount;
            }
        } else {
            if (isPositive) {
                voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST] - amount;
                voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST];
            } else {
                voteDelta[0] = market.votes[TRUST];
                voteDelta[1] = market.votes[DISTRUST] - amount;
            }
        }

        int256 costRatio = LMSR.getCost(
            market.votes[TRUST], market.votes[DISTRUST], voteDelta[0], voteDelta[1], market.liquidityParameter
        );

        uint256 positiveCostRatio = costRatio > 0 ? uint256(costRatio) : uint256(costRatio * -1);
        // multiply cost ratio by base price to get cost; divide by 1e18 to apply ratio
@>      cost = positiveCostRatio.mulDiv(market.basePrice, 1e18, isPositive ? Math.Rounding.Floor : Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
```

The ratio is calculated via [getCost()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/LMSR.sol#L93).

```solidity
 function getCost(
    uint256 currentYesVotes,
    uint256 currentNoVotes,
    uint256 outcomeYesVotes,
    uint256 outcomeNoVotes,
    uint256 liquidityParameter
  ) public pure returns (int256 costDiff) {
    uint256 oldCost = _cost(currentYesVotes, currentNoVotes, liquidityParameter);
    uint256 newCost = _cost(outcomeYesVotes, outcomeNoVotes, liquidityParameter);
    costDiff = int256(newCost) - int256(oldCost);
  }

  function _cost(
    uint256 yesVotes,
    uint256 noVotes,
    uint256 liquidityParameter
  ) public pure returns (uint256 costResult) {
    // Compute e^(yes/b) and e^(no/b)
    (UD60x18 yesExp, UD60x18 noExp) = _getExponentials(yesVotes, noVotes, liquidityParameter);

    // sumExp = e^(yes/b) + e^(no/b)
    UD60x18 sumExp = yesExp.add(noExp);

    // lnVal = ln(e^(yes/b) + e^(no/b))
    UD60x18 lnVal = sumExp.ln();

    // Unwrap lnVal and multiply by b (also in UD60x18) to get cost
    uint256 lnValUnwrapped = unwrap(lnVal);
    costResult = lnValUnwrapped * liquidityParameter;
  }
```
From the code snippets above is visible that each of the old and new cost are multiplied by the liquidity parameter, which is retrieved from the market configuration.

However, the minimum liquidity value is `100` and the minimum base price is `0.0001 ether`

This means that in case of the minimum values provided in the market configuration, there is a need for rounding, which is implemented in `_calcCost()`. However the rounding is implemented based on the type of the vote being bought or sold, which might lead to user receiving some funds from the initial liquidity, which breaks the following invariant:

>The contract must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.  



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A market config with minimum values should be created.
2. The exploited market should be created with the config from 1.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User buys DISTRUST votes 
2. There are other buys and sells
3. The user sells DISTRIST votes

### Impact

The invariant:
>The contract must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited as part of trading. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.

is broken, because the user could be paid some weis from the initial liquidity.


### PoC

A user buys DISTRUST votes which will cost 1....8.9 weis. He pays 1.....9.0 weis, because of the rounding up.
Other users buy and sell votes
The user again buys DISTRUST votes which will cost 2....5.8 wies, and he pays 2....6.0 weis, because of the rounding up.
The total overpayed amount is 0.3 weis
Other users buy and sell votes.
The user again does the operations above.

After some time he start selling his votes.
The first one is sold for 3......4.6, and he receives 3......5.0
The second one is sold for 2.....3.5, and he receives 2.....4.0
The total overreceived amount is 0.9 weis.

He continues to do that, in the end the difference should be payed by the initial liquidity.


### Mitigation

Option 1: Update the minimum values in the market configuration to not need rounding.

Option 2: Round up when buying and round down when selling, so the protocol is not insolvent.
