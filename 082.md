# Overestimation of Exit Fees in `ReputationMarket::previewExitFees`

### Summary

#### Issue:
The `previewExitFees` function overestimates the exit fees because it incorrectly assumes that the `proceedsBeforeFees` value includes only the base price, while it actually includes the tax amount. This leads to an inflated `protocolFee` calculation, resulting in an incorrect `totalProceedsAfterFees`.

#### Explanation of Tax Calculation:

When buying and selling votes, the Ethos protocol applies tax differently, depending on whether the tax is added to the price (in the case of `buyVotes`) or removed from the price (in the case of `sellVotes`). Here's how the tax should be applied in each case:

- **Buying Votes** (`buyVotes`): Tax is added to the purchase price. The user pays the price plus the tax.

$$
  \text{Tax Amount} = \text{Purchase Price} \times \frac{\text{Tax Rate}}{100}
$$
$$
  \text{Total Price} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Tax Amount}
$$

  Example: If the purchase price is $100 and the tax rate is 5%, the user ends up paying $105, with $5 being tax.

- **Selling Votes** (`sellVotes`): The price already includes tax, so the tax is subtracted from the total price to determine the amount the user should receive.

$$
  \text{Tax Amount} = \text{Price Including Tax} \times \frac{\text{Tax Rate}}{100 + \text{Tax Rate}}
$$
$$
  \text{Price Before Tax} = \text{Price Including Tax} - \text{Tax Amount}
$$

  Example: If the price including tax is $105 and the tax rate is 5%, the tax component is $5, leaving $100 as the amount to be paid to the user.

#### The Problem with `previewExitFees`:

The issue with the current implementation of `previewExitFees` is that it calculates the protocol fee assuming the `proceedsBeforeFees` does not include tax. However, `proceedsBeforeFees` already includes tax, leading to the calculation of the protocol fee based on an inflated value.

```solidity
  function previewExitFees(
    uint256 proceedsBeforeFees
  ) private view returns (uint256 totalProceedsAfterFees, uint256 protocolFee) {
>>>    protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;

    totalProceedsAfterFees = proceedsBeforeFees - protocolFee;
  }
```

To correct this, the protocol fee calculation must exclude the tax already included in `proceedsBeforeFees`. The proper formula to account for this is:

```diff
  function previewExitFees(
    uint256 proceedsBeforeFees
  ) private view returns (uint256 totalProceedsAfterFees, uint256 protocolFee) {
-   protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
+   protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / (100 * BASIS_POINTS_BASE + exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints);

    totalProceedsAfterFees = proceedsBeforeFees - protocolFee;
  }
```


### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket::previewExitFees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1123), the `protocolFee` is calculated as if the tax is not already included in the `proceedsBeforeFees` variable.

### Impact

The current implementation of the `previewExitFees` function overestimates the `protocolFee` and underestimates the `totalProceedsAfterFees`, leading to a loss of funds for the user. For instance, if `proceedsBeforeFees` is $105, the `protocolFee` is calculated as $5.25 (instead of $5), which is 5% higher than the correct fee amount. This overestimation results in the user receiving less than they should.

### Mitigation

To correct this, the protocol fee calculation must exclude the tax already included in `proceedsBeforeFees`. The proper formula to account for this is:

```diff
  function previewExitFees(
    uint256 proceedsBeforeFees
  ) private view returns (uint256 totalProceedsAfterFees, uint256 protocolFee) {
-   protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
+   protocolFee = (proceedsBeforeFees * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / (100 * BASIS_POINTS_BASE + exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints);

    totalProceedsAfterFees = proceedsBeforeFees - protocolFee;
  }
```
