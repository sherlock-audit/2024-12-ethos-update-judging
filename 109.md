# Profiles can get stuck with incorrect config on config removal during market creation

### Summary

Profiles can get get stuck with unintended config at the time of creation if a config is removed at the same time.
LoC: 
[createMarketWithConfig](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L284)
[removeMarketConfig](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L398-404)

### Root Cause

The protocol allows whitelisted profiles to create markets with config of choice by providing the index. This index-based approach could become problematic if the `marketConfigs` array is changed via `removeMarketConfig` before a profiletries to create a market. Here's how `removeMarketConfig` works,
- Given an index, check if given index is last index.
- If it's not, swap config at last index with current config.
- Pop the last config.

```solidity

  uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
      marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    }

    // Remove the last element
    marketConfigs.pop();
 
```

This means, if market provides an index to `createMarketWithConfig` and that config at given index ceases to exist, the last config in 
the array would take its place via swap & as long as the msg.value as enough to cover `creationCost`,it would be utilized, creating market at that config. 

#### For example

**Ok, let's say there are 5 configs, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
creationCost0 = 0.2, creationCost1 = 0.5, creationCost2 = 1.0, creationCost3 = 1.2, creationCost4 = 1.0**
- Profile decides to buy config1 and provides 1 ether (the function would return the extra).
- At the same time, admin decides to remove config1 and this runs first (due to more gas or validator wanting to harm profile by making sure this goes through first).
- Now, config1 will get swapped with config4 and the `_createMarket` for config at index1 would go through as msg.value is still enough to cover creationCost, resulting in profile getting stuck with config4. It's not like a profile can upgrade configs afterwards!

Basically, even if another config takes place of the config being removed, as long as msg.value is enough to cover `creationCost` of this swapped config at the questioned index, the transaction will not revert!

The issue is, the config of a market cannot be changed after creation and profile sticks with that forever.

The config removals won't happen often, but when they do, it could get problematic for market creators with enough msg.value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Transactions `removeMarketConfig` & `createMarketWithConfig` need to happen at the same time; both should be in mempool.

### External Pre-conditions

1. `removeMarketConfig` should execute first from the mempool.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Profile would be tied to unintended tier which they cannot change later.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider removing the `whenNotPaused` modifier from `removeMarketConfig` & pause protocol before config removals to avoid problems for new market creators.
