# disruptive `onlyAdmin` function can impact user experience

### Summary

disruptive admin only function like [`removeMarketConfig`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L388), [`setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L683), [`setExitProtocolFeeBasisPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L696), [`setProtocolFeeAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L709C12-L709C33) for example should be called by making announcement to the user/community. however, modifying these settings without proper safeguards such as a pause mechanism or time-lock, can lead to accidental interactions between users and the protocol, resulting in unexpected outcomes..

### Root Cause

The root cause is the lack of mechanisms to manage the immediate effect of changes made by admin-only functions. These functions inherit the whenNotPaused modifier, meaning they cannot be executed while the contract is paused. Additionally, there is no on-chain mechanism to notify users of configuration changes at the time of interaction.

to be more clear:
admin changing config -> config immediately take effect -> user interact with different config (like different market config, or different fee structure)

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

this would be problematic if there are user that try to interact with the protocol at said moment and would makes unexpected transaction (like paying more fees than intended if the fees are changed, or making different market than anticipated)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. allow admin-only functions that modify settings to bypass the whenNotPaused modifier. This would enable a smoother flow for making changes like this: `admin apply pause -> admin change config -> unpause`

2. introduce a delay for admin-only functions that modify critical settings. This delay ensures users are notified in advance and can prepare for the changes before they take effect.
