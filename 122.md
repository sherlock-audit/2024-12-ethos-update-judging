# Liquidity Mismatch / Under-Collateralization Risk

### Summary

A malicious or careless admin/upgrade will drain or mismanage contract ETH, causing users to be unable to redeem their votes (sell) or withdraw funds.

The contract stores the amount of locked funds in marketFunds[profileId] but does not enforce that address(this).balance is always ≥ the sum of all marketFunds. Thus, an admin or upgrade could withdraw or transfer ETH from the contract without updating marketFunds[...]. Users expecting to sell votes are left with insufficient actual ETH in the contract.

Impact
This mismatch will cause a complete inability to redeem votes for users, as an admin (or a malicious upgrade) will remove ETH so that sellVotes() or other withdrawals revert when trying to pay sellers.

### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol, there is no explicit code segment preventing the contract’s ETH balance from dropping below the total of marketFunds[profileId]. The relevant storage:


`mapping(uint256 => uint256) public marketFunds; `
tracks how much ETH is "allocated" to each market, but there is no mechanism ensuring:


`address(this).balance >= Σ(marketFunds[allActiveMarkets]).`
A conceptual mistake is made by not having an invariant that ties on-chain balance to the internal marketFunds ledger.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1-Admin (or a future upgrade) has the ability to transfer ETH out of the contract without zeroing out or reducing marketFunds[profileId].
2-No built-in guard or check (e.g., require(address(this).balance >= totalMarketFunds)) for normal function calls.

### External Pre-conditions

1-Users have deposited ETH by buying votes, so marketFunds[profileId] is non-zero.
2-A mechanism (e.g., an upgraded function or an external call) that can remove ETH from the contract exists or can be introduced.
3-The L2 or environment does not prevent arbitrary transfers.

### Attack Path

1-Admin or a privileged role (possibly via an upgrade) adds a function like forceWithdrawETH(amount) that transfers ETH from the contract to the admin’s address.
2-This function does not adjust or reduce marketFunds[...]. The contract’s reported marketFunds is still large, but address(this).balance is now smaller (or even zero).
3-A user tries to `sellVotes()`
- The contract calls _sendEth(proceedsAfterFees);
- The actual address(this).balance is insufficient to pay the user.
- The sell transaction reverts, freezing the user’s funds.


### Impact

Affected Party: Any user holding trust/distrust votes.

Loss:
- 1- Inability to Withdraw: The user cannot redeem their votes for ETH—any attempt reverts due to insufficient contract balance.
- 2- Potential Collateral Loss: If the market never gets re-collateralized, user stakes are effectively stuck.

Gain for Attacker: The malicious admin or role might siphon out the contract’s ETH for personal use.

### PoC

hypothetical Foundry test that illustrates a malicious upgrade scenario:

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/ReputationMarket.sol";

contract LiquidityMismatchTest is Test {
    ReputationMarket rm;
    address admin = address(0xA1);
    address user = address(0xB1);

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy the contract and set 'admin' as the owner
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        rm = new ReputationMarket();
        // Suppose we initialize + create a market
        // rm.initialize(...);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function testUnderCollateralization() public {
        // Step 1: user buys votes for some profile
        vm.deal(user, 10 ether);
        vm.startPrank(user);
        // user calls rm.buyVotes(...) with e.g. 1 ETH
        // This sets marketFunds[profileId] = 1 ETH, but also increases contract balance by 1 ETH
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Step 2: malicious 'admin' forcibly transfers out the contract's ETH
        // e.g., assume there's an upgraded function or a direct selfdestruct in an upgraded code
        vm.prank(admin);
        // Hypothetical direct send from contract's address or an upgrade that bypasses checks
        payable(admin).transfer(address(rm).balance);

        // Step 3: user tries to sell votes
        vm.startPrank(user);
        // This will fail as address(this).balance in rm is now 0, but marketFunds might still be 1 ETH
        vm.expectRevert(); 
        // rm.sellVotes(...) => reverts on insufficient balance
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```
The user’s sell attempt reverts, confirming the mismatch scenario.

### Mitigation

1- Enforce Collateral Invariant
For any new function or upgrade that sends ETH out, require address(this).balance >= sum(marketFundsForActiveMarkets) - (amount being withdrawn).

2-Restrict or Lock Down Upgradability
Ensure no admin function can remove funds unless markets are graduated or zeroed out.

3-Implement a Strict “No External Withdraw” Rule
The only way to remove funds from a non-graduated market should be via user sells or official graduation.
