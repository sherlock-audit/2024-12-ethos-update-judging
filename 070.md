# cntracts sould use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` as it supports upgradable contracts, unlike ReentrancyGuard

### Summary

Currently `ReputationMarket` is upgradable and possibly planning upgrade in the future. indicators for such behavior are 

1.  `ReputationMarket` using `UUPSUpgradeable`
2. The added gap inside both `ReputationMarket` and it's inherited `AccessControl`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L151
```solidity
  uint256[50] private __gap;
```
3. `AccessControl` being upgradable too

However even though the team intentions are for `ReputationMarket` to be upgradable it still lacks the necessary stability as it still uses the normal non-upgradable `ReentrancyGuard`, which has variable in it:

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L37C1-L40C29
```solidity
    uint256 private constant NOT_ENTERED = 1;
    uint256 private constant ENTERED = 2;

    uint256 private _status;
```

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. Oz to add a param inside `ReentrancyGuard`
2. Admins to upgrade the contracts

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Upgrading such contracts may be dangerous as if OZ (notorious for changing their standard contracts) has added some params to `ReentrancyGuard` it would cause a storage collision inside `ReputationMarket`, bricking the contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` instead of `ReentrancyGuard` in order to make the contracts more secure.
