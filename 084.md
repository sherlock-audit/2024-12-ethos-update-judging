# LMSR invariant does not hold on `simulateBuy`

### Summary

The invariant described [in the code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L22C12-L22C141) states that the price of trust vote and the distrust vote must always sum up to the market's base price. While this is taken care of in the `getVotePrice` function, it's not the function used when actually simulating buy and sell. Therefore, the invariant doesn't hold on the simulated funds paid. 

### PoC

Add the following test in `rep.market.test.ts` 

```javascript
  describe('POC: LMSR invariant breaks on simulation', () => {
    it('POC', async () => {

      // Please NOTE: protocolfee and donation is 0 in this example
      // Vreifiable by console.log() the tuple values inside the simulateBuy method

      const market = await reputationMarket.getMarket(DEFAULT.profileId);

      // Price of 1 TRUST vote
      const trustVotePrice = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(
        DEFAULT.profileId,
        true,
      );

      // Simulated price of 1 TRUST vote
      const { simulatedFundsPaid: simulatedTrustVotePrice } = await userA.simulateBuy({
        buyAmount: DEFAULT.buyAmount * 100n,
        votesToBuy: 1n,
        isPositive: true,
      });

      // Price of 1 DISTRUST vote
      const distrustVotePrice = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(
        DEFAULT.profileId,
        false,
      );

      // Simulated price of 1 DISTRUST vote
      const { simulatedFundsPaid: simulateDistrustVotePrice } = await userA.simulateBuy({
        buyAmount: DEFAULT.buyAmount * 100n,
        votesToBuy: 1n,
        isPositive: false,
      });

      expect(simulatedTrustVotePrice).to.not.equal(trustVotePrice);
      expect(simulateDistrustVotePrice).to.not.eq(distrustVotePrice);

      // Sum total of trust price and distrust price is equal to base price as per the `getVotePrice` which is expected
      expect(trustVotePrice + distrustVotePrice).to.be.equal(market.basePrice);

      // Now, let's see where I think the problem is ..

      // NOTE: Here, even though there is 0 protocol fee and  0 donation fee,
      // the sum total of trust and distrust price does not equal base price when it comes to funds being paid at a given
      // point in time.
      expect(simulateDistrustVotePrice + simulatedTrustVotePrice).to.be.greaterThan(market.basePrice);

    });
  });

```
