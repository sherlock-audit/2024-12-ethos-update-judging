# Potential Out-of-Gas Scenario

### Summary

The current implementation of the _calculateBuy logic uses a while loop to decrement the number of tickets (currentVotesToBuy) one by one until the total cost, including fees, fits within msg.value. This approach has significant downsides:
	1.	High Time Complexity:
The loop runs in O(N) time in the worst case, where N is the initial value of maxVotesToBuy. This means that for very large values of maxVotesToBuy (e.g., tens or hundreds of thousands), the contract may perform thousands of iterations, each recalculating the total cost and fees using _calculateBuy. This results in excessive gas usage.
	2.	DoS Vulnerability:
Attackers could deliberately set maxVotesToBuy to an extremely high value to force the loop into a large number of iterations. This could deplete gas and render the transaction unexecutable, making it a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vector.

### Mitigation

Instead of decrementing from maxVotesToBuy one ticket at a time, use binary search within the range of 0 to maxVotesToBuy to quickly narrow down the number of tickets that can be purchased. This significantly reduces repeated calls to _calculateBuy(â€¦), lowering the complexity from O(N) to O(log N).
