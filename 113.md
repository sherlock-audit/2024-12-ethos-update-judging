# User when selling votes will lose money due to selling an unwanted price

### Summary

`sellVotes()` function calculates the price per vote based on the amount of ETH before the fee instead of the amount of ETH that the seller received. This will cause the seller losing money due to selling an unwanted price



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L553
The slippage check when selling is based on price before fee instead of price after fee

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users need to buy votes previously

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user wants to sell 100 votes with the minimum vote price being 0.1 ether
2. The expected amount of ETH received by the user should be at least 10 ether (0.1 * 100)
3. The user calls to the `sellVotes()` function with `minimumVotePrice = 0.1e18`
4.  In `sellVotes()` function, the result of `_calculateSell()` is: `proceedsBeforeFees = 10.1e18`, `proceedsAfterFees = 9.6e18`. This means users only receiving `9.6e18` after selling
5. Because `pricePerVote` is calculated based on `proceedsBeforeFees`, `pricePerVote` will be `10.1e18 / 100 = 1.01e18`, which is greater than `minimumVotePrice`. Due to that, the slippage check got surpassed 
6. In the end, the amount of user received will be `9.6e18` even though the minimum expected is `10e18`

### Impact

Sellers will lose money when selling votes. The maximum loss will be 5% amount of selling price, since maximum fee is 5%
