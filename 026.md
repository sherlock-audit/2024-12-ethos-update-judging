# Market Configuration Vote Initialization Discrepancy

### Summary

The `createMarketWithConfig` function in the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract allows users to create markets using predefined configurations (Default, Deluxe, Premium) with associated liquidity and vote levels. However, the `_createMarket` function sets the initial votes for Trust and Distrust to 1, regardless of the selected tier. This discrepancy results in all markets being initialized at the `Default` tier's vote levels, even when users pay for higher-tier configurations like `Deluxe` or `Premium`.

This behavior misaligns with the intended design and user expectations, potentially leading to disputes and dissatisfaction from users who do not receive what they pay for. 

Prices are determined by a bonding curve formula based on the ratio of Trust and Distrust votes. Initializing both with a minimal value (1) creates disproportionate sensitivities to small changes in votes, resulting in unpredictable and unstable pricing dynamics.

### Root Cause

The issue can be observed here : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L318-L355

```Solidity
  function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
    uint256 marketConfigIndex
  ) private nonReentrant {
    // ensure a market doesn't already exist for this profile
    if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] != 0 || markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] != 0)
      revert MarketAlreadyExists(profileId);

    // ensure the specified config option is valid
    if (marketConfigIndex >= marketConfigs.length)
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Invalid config index");

    uint256 creationCost = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].creationCost;

    // Handle creation cost, refunds and market funds for non-admin users
    if (!hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
      if (msg.value < creationCost) revert InsufficientLiquidity(creationCost);
      marketFunds[profileId] = creationCost;
      if (msg.value > creationCost) {
        _sendEth(msg.value - creationCost);
      }
    } else {
      // when an admin creates a market, there is no minimum creation cost; use whatever they sent
      marketFunds[profileId] = msg.value;
    }

    // Create the new market using the specified config
    markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = 1;
    markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = 1;
    markets[profileId].basePrice = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].basePrice;
    markets[profileId].liquidityParameter = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].liquidity;

    donationRecipient[profileId] = recipient;

    emit MarketCreated(profileId, msg.sender, marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex]);
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
In this function, no matter what the `marketIndexConfig`(0,1 or 2) is, the market will always be of type `default` because      
    
```Solidity
    markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = 1;  //@audit always default type
    markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = 1; //@audit always default type
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* Users who create markets at higher tiers (Deluxe or Premium) are not assigned the appropriate vote levels, reducing the liquidity and stability of their markets.
* Users paying higher creation costs do not receive the benefits associated with these tiers, leading to potential disputes and reputational risks for the protocol.
* Market behaviors and pricing based on vote levels will be skewed due to incorrectly initialized markets, affecting fairness in price discovery.

### PoC

Steps to Reproduce:

* Call the `createMarketWithConfig` function with ex. `marketConfigIndex = 2` (Premium tier), which should initialize 10,000 votes for Trust and Distrust.

* Observe that the actual votes for the created market are set to 1 for both Trust and Distrust.

### Mitigation

Add `initialVotes` in the `MarketConfigs` struct.
And update the `_createMarket` by doing:
```Solidity
    markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].initialVotes;
    markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].initialVotes;
```
