# A user can have less votes than minimum votes that he specified

### Summary

A user can have fewer votes than the specified minimum if they set a maxVotes value that is lower than the minimum number of votes.

### Root Cause

In `buyVotes`, there is no check to ensure that maxVotesToBuy is greater than minVotesToBuy, as we can see here : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L440-L449
which means the purchased votes will be less than or equal to maxVotesToBuy and, therefore, less than minVotesToBuy as we can see here : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-ethos-update/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L452-L467

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Bob wants to buy some votes from a market. 
2. He want to disable the maxvotes so he set the maxVotesToBuy to 0.
3. He get absolutely no votes from the call.

### Impact

The user will not get the votes he wants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check with a custom error that will ensure that the minimum is less than the maximum of votes.
